## �🔔 Latest Updates (Newest First)

### 2026-02-16 — Phase H: Full Crypto Regime Autonomy

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Feature-flagged)
**Feature Flags**: `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_ENABLED` (default false), `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_LIVE_AUTONOMY` (default false), `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_KILL_SWITCH` (default false)

Full autonomous regime management for crypto with hard fail-safe protections. Paper mode auto-applies regime flips; live mode generates proposals only unless explicitly enabled.

#### Architecture: 2-Layer Regime Engine

**Layer 1 — Composite Macro Engine** (`composite_macro_engine.py`):
5 weighted components → RISK_ON / NEUTRAL / RISK_OFF / PANIC

| Component | Weight | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| BTC regime | 0.40 | BTC 4h bars (trend + volatility) |
| ETH regime | 0.20 | ETH 4h bars (trend + volatility) |
| Total market trend | 0.15 | Universe-wide trend consensus |
| Alt vs BTC strength | 0.15 | Alt-coin relative strength |
| Volatility expansion | 0.10 | Market-wide vol measurement |

**Layer 2 — Per-Asset Regime Engine** (`asset_regime_engine.py`):
4 weighted components per symbol → VERY_STRONG / STRONG / NEUTRAL / WEAK

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Trend | 0.35 |
| Volatility contraction | 0.25 |
| Relative strength | 0.20 |
| Momentum | 0.20 |

#### Exposure Ladder (Risk Thermostat)

`effective_cap = base_cap * clamp(confidence, 0.35, 0.95)`

| Macro Regime | Base Cap | Example (conf=0.80) |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| RISK_ON | 1.00 | 0.80 |
| NEUTRAL | 0.75 | 0.60 |
| RISK_OFF | 0.40 | 0.32 |
| PANIC | 0.10 | 0.08 |

#### 30-Minute Autonomy Cycle

1. Kill switch check
2. Load 4h bars (BTC, ETH, universe)
3. Compute composite macro score
4. Compute per-asset scores
5. Compute drift score (4-component, flip candidate if >= 0.75)
6. Evaluate fail-safes (4 layers)
7. Evaluate guardrails
8. Adjust confidence
9. Flip regime if eligible (paper: auto-apply; live: proposal only)
10. Compute exposure cap
11. Persist state + JSONL log

#### 4-Layer Fail-Safe Hierarchy

| Layer | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| A: Circuit Breaker | Daily PnL <= -2%, DD <= -3%, 3 stops in 6h | Halt entries, adaptive cooldown (6-24h) |
| B: Shock Mode | DD <= -25% or vol >= 2.5x baseline | Halt entries, lock flips, exposure override 10% |
| C: Data Integrity | Missing data, Phase F insufficient_data | Confidence decay, lock flips, exposure safety factor |
| D: Auto-Revert | PnL < -1% within 6-12h after flip | Revert to last stable regime, 24h lock |

#### Flip Budget

- Max 3 regime flips per rolling 7-day window
- 24-hour lockout when budget exhausted
- Auto-reverts consume flip budget

#### Module Files (`phase_h_crypto_regime/`)

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `config.py` | 105 | Feature flags + all constants |
| `persistence.py` | 109 | Append-only JSONL + run_state.json |
| `composite_macro_engine.py` | 254 | Layer 1: 5-component weighted macro score |
| `asset_regime_engine.py` | 203 | Layer 2: Per-asset regime scoring |
| `exposure_ladder.py` | 57 | Risk thermostat: regime + confidence -> exposure cap |
| `drift_scoring.py` | 159 | 4-component drift score for flip eligibility |
| `flip_budget.py` | 103 | Max 3 flips / 7 days enforcement |
| `fail_safe_engine.py` | 335 | 4-layer fail-safe hierarchy |
| `guardrails.py` | 102 | Combined eligibility checks |
| `autonomy_engine.py` | 530 | Core 30-min cycle orchestrator |
| `scheduler.py` | 51 | Thin integration wrapper |
| `__init__.py` | 23 | Public API exports |

#### Integration Points

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `crypto_main.py` | Startup run + 30-min scheduler task + `_run_phase_h_cycle()` |
| `crypto/pipeline/crypto_pipeline.py` | Phase H exposure cap + halt check before signal generation |
| `config/crypto/paper.kraken.crypto.global.yaml` | `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_ENABLED = true` |
| `config/crypto/live.kraken.crypto.global.yaml` | `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_ENABLED = true`, `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_LIVE_AUTONOMY = false` |
| `run_paper_kraken_crypto.sh` | Phase H env vars (enabled, kill switch) |
| `run_live_kraken_crypto.sh` | Phase H env vars (enabled, live autonomy disabled, kill switch) |

#### Persistence

`persist/phase_h/{scope}/crypto/`:
- `regime_autonomy.jsonl` — Main cycle log (append-only)
- `run_state.json` — Mutable state (current regime, flip history, fail-safe state)
- `asset_scores.jsonl` — Per-asset scoring history (append-only)
- `fail_safe_events.jsonl` — Fail-safe trigger log (append-only)

#### Runtime Attributes (set on `runtime` for pipeline consumption)

| Attribute | Type | Default | Usage |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| `phase_h_exposure_cap` | float | 1.0 | Multiplied against available capital in pipeline |
| `phase_h_macro_regime` | str | "NEUTRAL" | Current macro regime label |
| `phase_h_halt_new_entries` | bool | False | Blocks signal generation when True |
| `phase_h_asset_scores` | dict | {} | Per-symbol score + regime for downstream use |

#### Paper vs Live Behavior

| Behavior | Paper | Live |
|----------|-------|------|
| Regime flips | Auto-applied | Proposal only (logged, not applied) |
| Exposure cap | Applied to pipeline | Applied to pipeline |
| Fail-safes | Full enforcement | Full enforcement |
| Kill switch | `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_KILL_SWITCH=true` | `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_KILL_SWITCH=true` |
| Override | — | `PHASE_H_CRYPTO_LIVE_AUTONOMY=true` to enable auto-apply |

#### Phase H Replaces Legacy Regime for Strategy Selection

When Phase H is active, its composite macro regime (`RISK_ON`/`NEUTRAL`/`RISK_OFF`/`PANIC`) is the **sole authority** for strategy eligibility. The legacy `CryptoRegimeEngine` still runs for logging and regime history but no longer gates which strategies are eligible.

This eliminates double-restriction where legacy regime and Phase H both independently constrain the pipeline. Phase H controls:
- **Strategy selection** — via macro regime → strategy eligibility map
- **Exposure sizing** — via exposure cap (confidence-weighted)
- **Entry halting** — via fail-safe `halt_new_entries`

The legacy regime engine provides:
- **Logging/observability** — regime history, transition tracking
- **Recovery detection** — PANIC→NEUTRAL transition prices for recovery re-entry strategy

Also: `MAX_SYMBOLS_SCANNED_PER_CYCLE` bumped from 10 to 15 in paper config to scan all active universe symbols each tick.

### 2026-02-15 — Phase F: Persist Full Reasoning Chain (Articles, Claims, Hypotheses)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Severity**: Enhancement — Auditability of Phase F epistemic pipeline

#### Problem

Phase F (market correspondent) builds a full reasoning chain each run — articles with URLs, extracted claims, hypotheses, critic challenges — but only the final verdict was persisted. The entire chain was discarded after each run, making it impossible to:
- Verify which articles the system actually read
- Trace how claims were derived from articles
- See what hypotheses were formed or how the critic challenged them
- Audit whether the system is hallucinating or reasoning correctly

#### Fix: Persist reasoning chain per run

Added a single new JSONL file: `persist/phase_f/crypto/reasoning/reasoning_chains.jsonl`

Each line is one complete run containing:
- **articles**: title, source, source_url, published_at (content omitted to save space)
- **claims**: full Claim model dump (claim_text, source, source_url, confidence, sentiment, etc.)
- **hypotheses**: hypothesis_text, confidence, uncertainty, supporting/contradicting claim indices (references into claims array), reasoning_steps
- **challenges**: hypothesis_text, confidence, uncertainty, challenged_hypothesis_index (which hypothesis was challenged), reasoning_steps
- **verdict_type**: duplicated from verdict for quick filtering
- **stats**: num_articles, num_claims, num_hypotheses, num_challenges, unique_sources

~10-80KB per run, one run per day.

#### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `phase_f/persistence.py` | Added `reasoning_dir`, `reasoning_chain_path`, `append_reasoning_chain()` method (non-fatal, try/except) |
| `phase_f/phase_f_job.py` | Added `_build_reasoning_chain()` method; track `challenge_groups` in critic loop; persist chain after verdict (Stage 5) |
| `openclaw/SOUL.md` | Added Reasoning Chain section under File Reference; added terminology mapping |
| `openclaw/skills/trading-ops/SKILL.md` | Mirrored SOUL.md reasoning chain documentation |

#### What Did NOT Change

- No changes to pipeline logic (fetching, extraction, hypothesis building, critic, reviewer)
- No changes to verdict persistence (verdicts.jsonl stays as-is)
- No changes to pipeline.jsonl or audit_trail.jsonl logging
- No new dependencies

#### Verification

```bash
# Run Phase F manually
python3 -c "from phase_f.phase_f_job import run_phase_f_job; run_phase_f_job('crypto')"

# Check reasoning chain exists
python3 -c "import json; lines=open('persist/phase_f/crypto/reasoning/reasoning_chains.jsonl').readlines(); d=json.loads(lines[-1]); print(f'articles={len(d[\"articles\"])}, claims={len(d[\"claims\"])}, hypotheses={len(d[\"hypotheses\"])}, challenges={len(d[\"challenges\"])}')"
```

#### Ops Agent Usage

Ask the ops agent: "show me the articles the market correspondent read" or "why did the researcher reach this verdict?" — it will read from `reasoning_chains.jsonl`. Note: ops agent container needs rebuild (`run_ops_agent.sh`) since SOUL.md/SKILL.md are COPY'd in Dockerfile.

---

### 2026-02-15 — FIX: Ops Agent Data Access Gaps (SOUL.md / SKILL.md)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Severity**: MEDIUM — Ops agent returned wrong/missing data for 3 of 4 containers

#### Problems Found

Full audit of every file path in SOUL.md/SKILL.md against actual files on disk revealed 10 gaps:

| # | Issue | Impact |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Crypto scopes have no `open_positions.json` (positions are in-memory only) | Agent always reported "no positions" for crypto |
| 2 | Crypto scheduler uses `crypto_scheduler_state.json`, not `scheduler_state.json` | Agent couldn't find scheduler state for crypto |
| 3 | Governance proposals split across `logs/` and `persist/` (different UUIDs) | Agent only found half the proposals |
| 4 | Agent tried to `Read` directory paths instead of using `Glob` | "directory reading was illegal" errors |
| 5 | `errors.jsonl` only exists for `live_alpaca_swing_us` | Agent reported "not accessible" for 3 scopes |
| 6 | Phase G files don't exist (`PHASE_G_ENABLED` default OFF) | Agent reported missing files as errors |
| 7 | Swing `state/open_positions.json` is empty; real data is in `ledger/open_positions.json` | Agent reported "no positions" for swing scopes with holdings |
| 8 | `execution_log.jsonl` undocumented | Agent couldn't report execution details |
| 9 | `ai_advisor_calls.jsonl` undocumented | Agent couldn't report AI ranking data |
| 10 | Governance events exist in both `logs/` and `persist/` | Agent missed events |

#### Root Causes

- **Not a permissions issue** — volume mounts and tool access are correct
- **SOUL.md/SKILL.md file references didn't match actual file layout on disk**
- Crypto and swing scopes use different filenames, different persistence patterns
- Governance writes to both `logs/` (runtime) and `persist/` (durable)

#### Fixes Applied

All changes in `openclaw/SOUL.md` and `openclaw/skills/trading-ops/SKILL.md` (mirrored):

1. **Positions**: Separated swing vs crypto guidance. Swing: check all 3 paths in order, skip empty `{}`. Crypto: no position file exists; use `trades.jsonl` or `daily_summary.jsonl`.
2. **Scheduler state**: Added `crypto_scheduler_state.json` alongside `scheduler_state.json`.
3. **Governance proposals**: Search BOTH `persist/` and `logs/` paths with Glob.
4. **Directory listing**: New "How to List Directory Contents" section teaching Glob patterns (agent has no Bash/ls).
5. **errors.jsonl**: Added "(may not exist for all scopes)" + `daily_summary.jsonl` fallback + instruction to say "No structured error log" instead of "not accessible".
6. **Phase G**: Added blockquote notes: "Phase G is gated behind `PHASE_G_ENABLED` (default OFF). Report 'Phase G is not enabled' if files don't exist."
7. **New file references**: Added `execution_log.jsonl` (swing) and `ai_advisor_calls.jsonl` (crypto).
8. **Governance events**: Added `logs/governance/` path alongside `persist/governance/`.

#### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `openclaw/SOUL.md` | All 8 fixes above |
| `openclaw/skills/trading-ops/SKILL.md` | Mirrored all 8 fixes |

No code changes. Ops agent container rebuilt and restarted to pick up changes (SOUL.md/SKILL.md are COPY'd in Dockerfile.openclaw).

### 2026-02-15 — FIX: Graceful Degradation for Crypto Pipeline Market Data

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Severity**: HIGH — Availability (single-symbol timeout blocked entire universe)

#### Root Cause

In `crypto/pipeline/crypto_pipeline.py`, if ANY single symbol failed to fetch market data from Kraken (e.g., 10s API timeout), the **entire pipeline** returned an empty DataFrame — no trading for ANY symbol. A transient timeout on one altcoin (e.g., AVAX) blocked trading for BTC, ETH, SOL, and all other healthy symbols.

#### Fix Summary

Replaced the all-or-nothing market data check with tiered validation:

1. **Anchor symbol check**: If BTC (or first symbol) 4h regime candles are missing, full pipeline block (regime engine depends on BTC).
2. **Healthy symbol filtering**: Symbols missing either 5m or 4h data are excluded from the current cycle; remaining healthy symbols proceed normally.
3. **Majority threshold**: If >50% of the universe fails, full pipeline block (insufficient market coverage).
4. **Partial degradation logging**: New `MARKET_DATA_PARTIAL` log entry with `failed=` and `healthy=` lists for operational visibility.
5. **Removed duplicate anchor check**: The anchor validation in Stage 2 (FEATURES) was redundant with the new Stage 1 check.

#### Failure Severity Matrix

| Failure | Severity | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| BTC (anchor) data missing | CRITICAL | Block entire pipeline |
| >50% of universe missing | CRITICAL | Block entire pipeline |
| 1-2 non-anchor symbols missing | NON-CRITICAL | Exclude failed symbols, continue with healthy subset |

#### New Log Events

- `MARKET_DATA_PARTIAL` — emitted when some symbols fail but pipeline continues
- `DATA_LOADED` extra fields: `failed_symbols`, `healthy_count`, `original_count`

#### Files Changed

- `crypto/pipeline/crypto_pipeline.py` (replaced all-or-nothing check with graceful degradation)

---

### 2026-02-15 — Phase E v3: OpenClaw Ops Agent

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Replace the bespoke Phase E ops agent with an OpenClaw-based agent that reads all persisted data via filesystem tools and answers questions via Telegram with zero staleness.

#### Problems Solved

The old ops agent (`ops_agent/`, Python) responded with stale/incorrect data due to 7 issues: `latest_snapshot.json` never written, `daily_summary.jsonl` 12-24h behind, missing crypto positions, hardcoded paths, no Phase F/G awareness, grammar-based intent parser, and GPT-4o-mini fallback with no memory. OpenClaw replaces all of this with an LLM that reads files on-demand at query time.

#### Architecture

```
Docker Container (ops-agent, node:22-slim)
├── OpenClaw Gateway (:18789)
│   ├── Telegram Channel (inbound/outbound, allowlist-restricted)
│   └── trading-ops Skill (SKILL.md teaches data model)
├── /data/logs/:ro    ← host logs/ mounted read-only
├── /data/persist/:ro ← host persist/ mounted read-only
└── Cron: Daily digest at 10:00 PM ET
```

**Model**: Configurable via `OPENCLAW_MODEL` env var (default: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, uses existing `CHATGPT_API_KEY`)

#### Security & Isolation

| Concern | Enforcement |
|---------|-------------|
| No host filesystem access | Docker: only `logs/` and `persist/` mounted as read-only volumes |
| No internet except OpenAI + Telegram | Tools locked: `profile: minimal`, only `group:fs` allowed |
| No code execution | `group:runtime`, `group:web`, `group:sessions`, `group:messaging`, `group:nodes`, `group:ui`, `group:automation` all denied |
| No secrets in image | All credentials via env vars at runtime |

#### Files Created/Modified

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `Dockerfile.openclaw` | NEW | Node 22-slim + OpenClaw image, copies config + skill |
| `openclaw/openclaw.json` | NEW | Gateway config: Telegram channel, model, locked-down tools, cron |
| `openclaw/SOUL.md` | NEW | System prompt: data locations, architecture, anti-hallucination rules, Glob guidance |
| `openclaw/skills/trading-ops/SKILL.md` | NEW | Core skill: data locations, file reference, JSONL parsing, response guidelines |
| `openclaw/AGENTS.md` | NEW | Agent identity override: prevents heartbeat/memory interference |
| `run_ops_agent.sh` | MODIFIED | Builds from `Dockerfile.openclaw`, mounts both volumes `:ro`, passes OpenAI key |
| `.dockerignore` | MODIFIED | Added `Dockerfile.openclaw` to exclusions, ensured `openclaw/` not ignored |

#### Key Design: Auto-Discovery

New scopes (India swing, daytrade, options) require **zero changes**: they write to `logs/{scope}/` and `persist/{scope}/` following the same layout. The SKILL.md instructs the agent to list directories to discover all active scopes. No config changes, no image rebuild needed.

#### Migration

1. `docker stop ops-agent && docker rm ops-agent`
2. `./run_ops_agent.sh` (builds new image, starts OpenClaw)
3. Old `ops_agent/` Python code remains in repo as fallback

---

### 2026-02-14 — ML Training Pipeline: Reconciliation Trade Filtering Fix

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Production Patch)
**Severity**: HIGH — ML training blocked by incompatible trade data
**Root Cause**: Reconciliation-discovered positions lack ML features (`entry_features`)

#### Problem Discovery

After Feb 12 liquidation event, ML training attempted to use 120 trades but failed with cascading errors:
1. **First failure**: `'Trade' object has no attribute 'get'` — ML fingerprinting expected dicts, got Trade dataclasses
2. **Second failure**: `float() argument must be a string or a real number, not 'NoneType'` — Liquidation trades had `confidence=None`
3. **Third failure**: `Found array with 0 feature(s) (shape=(120, 0))` — All trades lacked `entry_features` dictionary

#### Root Cause Analysis

The 120 closed trades came from **reconciliation-discovered positions** (opened before tracking was in place):
- These positions were correctly hydrated from broker state during reconciliation
- When closed, they created valid Trade records with exit data
- However, they had **no strategy entry context**: no `entry_features`, no `confidence`, no ML signals
- ML training requires `entry_features` to build the feature matrix for training

**Key insight**: Not all trades are ML-trainable. Only strategy-opened positions capture the decision-time features needed for learning.

#### 3 Fixes Applied

| # | Fix | File | Description |
|---|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Trade/dict compatibility** | `ml/ml_state.py` (lines 203-238) | Added `_trade_field()` helper to handle both Trade dataclasses and dicts in fingerprinting |
| 2 | **None confidence handling** | `ml/dataset_builder.py` (lines 290-310) | Added None-safe confidence handling (`confidence if confidence is not None else 0.0`), fixed quantity field mapping |
| 3 | **Entry features filter** | `ml/dataset_builder.py` (lines 249-277) | Filter trades to require valid `entry_features`: `hasattr(t, 'entry_features') and t.entry_features is not None and len(t.entry_features) > 0` |

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `ml/ml_state.py` | Added `_trade_field()` helper for dict/dataclass compatibility in `compute_dataset_fingerprint()` |
| `ml/dataset_builder.py` | Filter `_collect_trades_from_ledger()` to require entry_features; handle None confidence; map quantity field |

#### Expected Behavior After Fix

- ML training correctly skips when no strategy-based trades exist: `"Dataset is empty. Skipping training."`
- Reconciliation trades (120) filtered out — they lack ML features by design
- ML will train once the system opens new strategy-based positions that capture `entry_features` at entry
- No crashes on Trade dataclass operations or None values
- Container validates and runs normally

#### Dataset State

- **Before fix**: 40 rows in dataset from old reconciliation trades (invalid for ML)
- **After fix**: 0 rows (dataset cleared and rebuilt with correct filter)
- **Current**: Paper swing has no strategy trades yet (expected — waiting for new positions)
- **Paper crypto**: 0 trades (regime is PANIC, no trading)

### 2026-02-12 — Phase G: Unified Autonomous Universe Governance + Regime Autonomy

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Feature-flagged, default OFF)
**Feature Flags**: `PHASE_G_ENABLED` (default false), `PHASE_G_DRY_RUN` (default true)

#### Phase G Universe Governance (`universe/governance/`)

Replaces the legacy OpenAI-based AI advisor (`runtime/ai_advisor.py`) with a deterministic, scope-aware scoring system for autonomous universe selection.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `config.py` | Feature flags, scoring weights, guardrail constants |
| `scorer.py` | 5-dimension scoring engine (performance 0.45, regime 0.25, liquidity 0.15, volatility 0.10, sentiment 0.05) |
| `governor.py` | Full pipeline orchestrator: score → rank → guardrails → persist |
| `guardrails.py` | Constitutional constraints: max 2 adds/removes per cycle, universe size 5-15, cooldown 7d, open position protection |
| `persistence.py` | Append-only JSONL: `persist/{scope}/universe/` — decisions.jsonl, active_universe.json, cooldowns.json, scoring_history.jsonl |
| `logging.py` | 3-layer transparency: pipeline.jsonl, audit_trail.jsonl, scoring_detail.jsonl |
| `regime_proxy.py` | SPY-based regime proxy for swing scope |

**Integration points**:
- `crypto_main.py`: Runs at startup + daily scheduler (replaces `ai_daily_ranking`)
- `main.py`: `_get_symbols_for_scope()` loads from `active_universe.json` when Phase G is on
- `crypto_pipeline.py`: Skips AI ranking when Phase G is on (universe already selected)
- YAML configs: `UNIVERSE_CANDIDATE_POOL` (15-symbol superset) added to paper + live configs

#### Phase G Regime Autonomy (`phase_g_regime/`)

Periodic regime validation and drift detection. Constitutional: never flips regime directly, only proposes non-binding changes.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `regime_validator.py` | Stage 1: Computes 4 validation scores (internal, external, drift, cross-asset) → verdict |
| `regime_alignment.py` | Helpers: regime distance, duration percentile, volatility band/shift detection |
| `regime_drift_detector.py` | Stage 2: 5-condition AND logic (all must hold for drift: confidence delta > 0.25, dwell met, duration anomaly > 80th percentile, volatility shift, >= 5 sources) |
| `regime_guardrails.py` | Stage 4: Cooldown, liquidity, Phase F data sufficiency, disagreement < 40%, max 2 flips/week |
| `regime_orchestrator.py` | Full pipeline + persistence + 3-layer logging + 90s timeout + idempotency |

**Scheduling**: Crypto runs every 2 hours (any trading state). Emergency drawdown override at < -25% bypasses dwell.

**Persistence**: `persist/phase_g/{scope}/regime/` — validation_runs.jsonl, proposals.jsonl, drift_history.jsonl, audit_trail.jsonl, run_state.json

**Fail-safe**: Timeout at 90s, defaults to current regime on failure, never blocks trading.

### 2026-02-12 — Liquidity Manager v2: 6 Critical Fixes (Over-Liquidation Prevention)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Production Patch)
**Severity**: CRITICAL — Prevented over-liquidation (20 of 29 positions sold instead of ~7)

#### Root Cause

The liquidation manager sold far too many positions to resolve an 8% heat limit. Two compounding bugs inflated apparent heat from ~22% to ~95%:

1. `risk_amount` was set to full notional value (`qty * entry_price` ≈ $5k/position) during hydration instead of the actual risk allocation (~$750/position)
2. The sell loop compared a risk-unit deficit against notional-unit cash freed, so it never converged properly

#### 6 Fixes Applied

| # | Fix | File(s) | Description |
|---|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **risk_amount inflated** | `account_reconciliation.py`, `crypto_reconciliation.py` | Replaced `qty * entry_price` with `equity * RISK_PER_TRADE * CONFIDENCE_RISK_MULTIPLIER` during hydration |
| 2 | **Sell loop unit mismatch** | `liquidity_manager.py` | Replaced static `cash_freed >= deficit` with dynamic `_detect_violations()` recheck after each sell; stops when heat ≤ 8% |
| 3 | **Cash reserve not persisted** | `liquidity_manager.py`, both reconciliation files | Added `CashReserve.to_dict()`/`from_dict()`, persist to `state/cash_reserve.json`, load on startup before violation check |
| 4 | **Pending orders silent** | `liquidity_manager.py` | Split `is_filled()`/`is_pending()` branch: filled → `LIQUIDATION_FILLED` (INFO), pending → `LIQUIDATION_PENDING` (WARNING) |
| 5 | **SAFE_MODE false trigger** | `account_reconciliation.py` | Added `"liquidity_resolved"` filter in `_determine_startup_status` (resolved = problem fixed, not a warning) |
| 6 | **Ledger not updated** | `liquidity_manager.py`, both reconciliation files | Added `trade_ledger` param; creates `LIQUIDITY_EXIT` trades via `create_trade_from_fills()`; removes from `_open_positions` to prevent `EXTERNAL_CLOSE` noise |

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `risk/liquidity_manager.py` | Fixes #2, #3, #4, #6: dynamic sell loop, reserve persistence (`to_dict`/`from_dict`/`load_cash_reserve`/`_save_cash_reserve`), filled vs pending logging, ledger trade recording |
| `broker/account_reconciliation.py` | Fixes #1, #3, #5, #6: correct `risk_amount`, load cash reserve on startup, `liquidity_resolved` SAFE_MODE filter, pass `trade_ledger` to `LiquidityManager` |
| `broker/crypto_reconciliation.py` | Fixes #1, #3, #6: correct `risk_amount`, load cash reserve on startup, pass `trade_ledger` to `LiquidityManager` |

#### Trading-State Counter Preservation

Liquidation is a risk-management action, not a trading decision. The sell loop now saves and restores these counters so forced exits don't poison the ML entry gates:

| Counter | Gate it feeds | What would happen without fix |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| `consecutive_losses` | `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_LOSSES = 3` | 3+ losing liquidation sells → all entries blocked → deadlock (no winning trade can reset counter) |
| `daily_pnl` | `DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT = 0.02` | Realized losses > 2% of equity → entries blocked for the day |
| `last_trade_return` | Feeds `consecutive_losses` | Overwritten by last liquidation sell return |
| `daily_trades_closed` | Informational | Inflated by liquidation count |

`current_equity` is intentionally **not** restored — it must reflect the real post-liquidation account value.

#### Expected Behavior After Fix

- Heat computes as ~22% (not ~95%) → only ~7 positions sold to reach ≤8%
- Scoring table shows real P&L% (broker `current_price` was already fixed prior)
- Sell loop stops dynamically when heat ≤ 8% (no unit mismatch)
- `LIQUIDATION_PENDING` log visible for each non-filled order
- Status shows `READY` (not `SAFE_MODE`) after successful liquidation
- `trades.jsonl` contains `LIQUIDITY_EXIT` entries (no `EXTERNAL_CLOSE` noise on restart)
- `state/cash_reserve.json` survives container restarts
- ML entries not blocked by liquidation losses (`consecutive_losses` and `daily_pnl` preserved)

### 2026-02-11 — Phase F Epistemic Fixes: Confidence Logic & Data Gates (CRITICAL PATCH)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Correction Patch)
**Severity**: CRITICAL — Fixes epistemically incorrect confidence/classification logic
**Test Suite**: 245/245 tests passing ✅ (14 new + 231 existing)

Fixed 5 critical problems in Reviewer logic:
1. **Confidence collapse on disagreement** → Added 0.4 floor protection
2. **Verdicts on insufficient data** → Added 8-source, 3-category, market-signals gate
3. **API failures as negative evidence** → Missing data capped at -15%
4. **Loose structural shift classification** → 4-gate system (all required)
5. **Unbounded confidence swings** → ±30%/-20% caps

Result: Disagreement = uncertainty, not panic. Structural shift rare and heavily gated.

### 2026-02-11 — Phase F Phase 1: Epistemic Market Intelligence (Core Infrastructure)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Phase 1)
**Severity**: CRITICAL FEATURE — Market awareness layer for regime validation

#### Phase F Overview

Phase F is a **READ-ONLY epistemic layer** that observes external market data and forms beliefs about regime validity. It has ZERO authority over execution and serves to increase epistemic humility rather than structural flexibility.

### 2026-02-09 — Phase D: BTC Regime Gate Analysis Layer

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v0 & v1)
**Severity**: MEDIUM — Analytical governance for regime gate calibration

#### Phase D Definition

Phase D is a **READ-ONLY analysis layer** that studies whether the BTC regime gate is potentially over-constraining. It answers: **"Is the BTC regime gate blocking too conservatively?"** WITHOUT changing any trading behavior.

Phase D runs **in the ops_agent** (not a separate job) and:
- **v0**: Detects regime blocks and collects post-facto evidence
- **v1**: Evaluates 5-rule eligibility framework to flag blocks as analyzable

Both versions are **feature-flagged (default FALSE)** for safety and can be deployed independently.

#### Phase D v0: Block Detection & Evidence Collection

**What it does**:
- Detects when regime blocks start/end from `daily_summary.jsonl`
- Collects post-facto metrics: upside missed, drawdowns, volatility changes
- Classifies blocks into 4 types: NOISE, COMPRESSION, SHOCK, STRUCTURAL
- Persists all data append-only (immutable JSONL format)

**Block Classification Logic** (evaluated in order):
1. **SHOCK**: `vol_expansion >= 2.0` OR `drawdown <= -10%` → Extreme volatility/drawdown
2. **NOISE**: `duration < 1.5x median` AND `upside < 3%` → Short, insignificant
3. **COMPRESSION**: `duration >= p90` AND `vol < 1.2x` AND `upside < 5%` → Long, low vol
4. **STRUCTURAL**: Default (long, high upside)

**Key Components**:
- `BlockDetector` — Reads `regime_blocked_period` field from daily summaries
- `EvidenceCollector` — Loads price data via `crypto_price_loader`, computes metrics
- `BlockClassifier` — Categorizes completed blocks
- `HistoricalAnalyzer` — Provides p90, median, min/max duration statistics
- `PhaseDPersistence` — Append-only JSONL storage (immutable)

#### Phase D v1: 5-Rule Eligibility Framework

**What it does**:
- Evaluates whether a regime block is "analyzable" (worthy of study)
- ALL 5 rules must pass for `eligible = True`
- Auto-expires 24h (forces re-evaluation)
- Feeds context into Phase E Telegram responses

**5 Eligibility Rules**:
1. **Evidence Sufficiency**: ≥3 completed blocks with evidence collected
2. **Duration Anomaly**: Current block > p90 (unusually long)
3. **Block Type**: Recent blocks are COMPRESSION or STRUCTURAL (not SHOCK)
4. **Cost-Benefit**: Missed upside > drawdown avoided in ≥2 blocks
5. **Regime Safety**: Regime not PANIC/SHOCK, volatility expansion normal

If any rule fails → `eligible = False`.

**Key Component**:
- `EligibilityChecker` — Evaluates all 5 rules, computes auto-expiry timestamp

#### Integration Points

**1. Runtime Observability** (`runtime/observability.py`):
```
Added regime_blocked_period field to daily_summary.jsonl:
{
  "is_blocked": bool,
  "block_duration_seconds": int,
  "regime": str,
  "strategies_eligible": int
}
```

**2. Crypto Pipeline** (`crypto/pipeline/crypto_pipeline.py`):
```
Hook after strategy selection:
get_observability().on_strategies_selected(eligible_names, regime)
```

**3. Ops Agent Responses** (`ops_agent/response_generator.py`):
```
When user asks "Why no trades?":
Bot shows Phase D context if available:
  [Phase D] Duration anomaly (>p90). Eligibility: TRUE. Expires: 18h.
```

#### Feature Flags (All Default FALSE)

```bash
# Enable v0 (block detection + evidence)
export PHASE_D_V0_ENABLED=true

# Enable v1 (eligibility evaluation)
export PHASE_D_V1_ENABLED=true

# Global kill-switch (overrides all)
export PHASE_D_KILL_SWITCH=false
```

#### Configuration

All settings in `config/phase_d_settings.py`:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `NOISE_DURATION_MULTIPLIER` | 1.5 | Duration threshold for NOISE |
| `NOISE_MAX_UPSIDE_PCT` | 3.0 | Upside threshold for NOISE |
| `COMPRESSION_VOL_EXPANSION_MAX` | 1.2 | Vol ratio threshold for COMPRESSION |
| `COMPRESSION_MAX_UPSIDE_PCT` | 5.0 | Upside threshold for COMPRESSION |
| `SHOCK_VOL_EXPANSION_MIN` | 2.0 | Vol ratio threshold for SHOCK |
| `SHOCK_MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT` | 10.0 | Drawdown threshold for SHOCK |
| `ELIGIBILITY_MIN_BLOCKS` | 3 | Min completed blocks for eligibility |
| `ELIGIBILITY_MIN_POSITIVE_CB` | 2 | Min blocks with positive cost-benefit |
| `ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRY_HOURS` | 24 | Auto-expire eligibility after 24h |

#### Persistence Structure

```
persist/phase_d/crypto/
├── blocks/
│   └── block_events.jsonl          # Block lifecycle events (append-only)
├── evidence/
│   └── evidence_<block_id>.json    # Evidence metrics per block

│   └── eligibility_history.jsonl   # Eligibility evaluations (append-only)
└── events/
    └── phase_d_events.jsonl        # Event log (append-only)
```

All files use **append-only JSONL** — immutable, never modified after creation.

#### Data Flow

| Aspect | Phase C | Phase D |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Scope | Governance proposals | Regime gate analysis |
| Runs | Weekly job (separate) | Every ops_agent tick |
| Decision Type | Proposals | Analytics/observations |
| AI Required | Yes (proposer) | No (rules-based) |
| Auto-Apply | Never | Never |
| Persistence | Proposals directory | Phase D directory |
| Integration | Standalone job | Embedded in ops_agent |

### 2026-02-09 — Step 5 Phase E: Interactive Ops & Concierge Agent

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Phase E v1)
**Severity**: MEDIUM — Human-friendly Telegram ops interface

#### Phase E Overview

Phase E is a **READ-ONLY, SAFE, BOUNDED Telegram bot** that answers one question:

> **"Do I need to care right now?"**

It explains:
- Why trades are or aren't happening
- What regime the system is in
- Whether anything is blocked
- Whether governance is waiting for human input

Completely passive: observes state, answers questions, never modifies anything.

#### Quick Start

**1. Get Telegram Bot Token**:
- Message `@BotFather` on Telegram
- Send `/newbot`, follow prompts
- Copy token

**2. Get Your Chat ID**:
- Message your bot any text
- Run: `curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`
- Find your chat ID in response

**3. Start Agent**:
```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='your-token'
export TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS='your-chat-id'
./run_ops_agent.sh
```

**4. Test**:
- Message bot: "Why no trades?"

#### Example Conversations

```
User: Why no trades?
Bot:  ⛔ live_crypto: Not trading — PANIC regime (safety off)

User: What regime?
Bot:  🟡 live_crypto: NEUTRAL

User: What happened today?
Bot:  📊 live_crypto: 3 trades, $124.50 PnL, -2.3% drawdown

User: Is governance waiting?
Bot:  ⚠️ 1 governance proposal awaiting your review
```

#### Capabilities (Phase E v1)

**On-Demand Explanations** (deterministic, no speculation):
- Explains why trades are/aren't happening
- Shows current regime
- Lists any blocks
- Reports daily stats
- Shows recent trade fills and execution history
- Reports holdings and positions with P&L
- Shows error history and system health
- Reports ML model state and training status
- Checks reconciliation health
- Checks governance status

**Data Sources** (read-only, graceful):
- `logs/<scope>/observability/latest_snapshot.json` – Latest state
- `logs/<scope>/logs/daily_summary.jsonl` – Performance history (all 4 scopes)
- `logs/<scope>/logs/ai_advisor_calls.jsonl` – AI ranking decisions
- `logs/<scope>/logs/scheduler_state.json` – Scheduler health
- `logs/<scope>/state/open_positions.json` – Current holdings with P&L
- `logs/<scope>/ledger/trades.jsonl` – Trade fills and entry/exit history
- `logs/<scope>/logs/errors.jsonl` – Error events with timestamps
- `logs/<scope>/state/reconciliation_cursor.json` – Reconciliation health status
- `logs/<scope>/state/ml_state.json` – ML model version and training state
- `logs/governance/crypto/proposals/` – Governance proposals and status

#### Hard Constraints

Agent MUST NEVER:
- Trade
- Approve governance
- Modify configs
- Restart containers
- Create jobs or cron
- Change any system state

If user asks for mutation: Bot refuses, explains current state.

#### Deployment

**Start** (24/7 Telegram polling):
```bash
./run_ops_agent.sh
```

**View Logs**:
```bash
docker logs -f ops-agent
```

**Stop**:

```

#### Architecture

**Separate ops-agent container**:
- 24/7 operation
- Polls Telegram API every 5 seconds
- Single-user access v1
- READ-ONLY to all system state
- Logs interactions (append-only)

**Components**:
- Telegram handler (polling + validation)
- Intent parser (deterministic grammar)
- Observability reader (latest state)
- Summary reader (daily stats, all 4 scopes)
- AI advisor reader (ranking decisions)
- Scheduler reader (job health)
- Positions reader (holdings with P&L)
- Trades reader (fill history)
- Errors reader (error events)
- Reconciliation reader (rec health)
- ML reader (model state & training)
- Response generator (concise replies)

#### Query Types & Examples

**Regime & Trading Status**:
- "What regime?" → Current market regime
- "Why no trades?" → Explains why trading is blocked
- "What happened today?" → Daily summary with stats
- "Status" → Overall system status

**Execution & Holdings**:
- "What's my position?" → Current holdings with P&L
- "What filled?" → Recent trade fills and entry/exit prices
- "Show my portfolio" → Holdings summary across scopes

**System Health**:
- "Any errors?" → Recent error events
- "System health?" → Overall health check (trading, reconciliation, errors)
- "Is it healthy?" → Health status with details
- "Check all containers" → Info about all 4 trading scopes

**ML & Model State**:
- "What's the AI ranking?" → Current AI advisor state
- "Model status?" → ML model version and training timestamp
- "ML state?" → Complete ML model state details

**Reconciliation**:
- "Rec health?" → Reconciliation status with any issues
- "Reconciliation status?" → Detailed rec state

**Governance**:
- "Any proposals?" → Pending governance proposals
- "Governance status?" → Governance state

**Multi-Scope Queries**:
- "all" or "containers" or "everything" → Returns info for all 4 scopes
- "live crypto" / "paper crypto" / "live us" / "paper us" → Specific scope

#### Recent Enhancements (2026-02-09)

**Daily Summaries for All Scopes**: Daily summaries (daily_summary.jsonl) now emit for all 4 trading scopes (live_kraken_crypto_global, paper_kraken_crypto_global, live_alpaca_swing_us, paper_alpaca_swing_us), providing historical performance data for the ops agent to analyze.

**Complete Data Access**: The ops agent can now access all persisted system data:
- Holdings and positions with P&L
- Trade fills and entry/exit history
- Error logs with timestamps
- Reconciliation health status
- ML model state and training information

**New Query Types**: Added query patterns for trades, ML state, reconciliation health, and system health checks.

#### Phase E v2: Temporal Awareness & Passive Notifications

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-02-09)
**Type**: ENHANCEMENT — Adds temporal context and passive watches to Phase E v1

**What's New**:
1. **Regime Duration Tracking** — Shows how long each regime has been active
2. **TTL-Based Watches** — Users can set temporary watches with expiration
3. **Historical Framing** — Adds expectation context to responses
4. **Optional Digest Mode** — Scheduled EOD summaries (opt-in)

**Example Conversations (v2)**:

```
User: watch live_crypto for 2h
Bot:  ✅ Watch created: regime_change (expires in 2h)

User: what regime?
Bot:  🟡 live_crypto: NEUTRAL (for 4h 12m) (typical: median ~3h)

User: why no trades?
Bot:  ⛔ No trades: PANIC regime (has occurred before in similar conditions)

[2 hours later]
Bot:  ⏱️ Watch expired: regime_change
```

**Feature Flags** (all default FALSE for backward compatibility):
- `OPS_ENABLE_WATCHES=true` — Enable watch manager
- `OPS_ENABLE_DURATION_TRACKING=true` — Enable regime duration tracking
- `OPS_ENABLE_HISTORICAL_FRAMING=true` — Enable historical context
- `OPS_ENABLE_DIGESTS=true` — Enable digest generation

**Configuration**:
```bash
# Watch settings
export OPS_WATCH_DEFAULT_TTL_HOURS=24
export OPS_WATCH_MAX_TTL_HOURS=72

# Digest settings
export OPS_DIGEST_TIME_UTC="01:00"  # 9 PM ET
```

**Files Created**:
- `ops_agent/duration_tracker.py` — Regime duration tracking
- `ops_agent/watch_manager.py` — Watch lifecycle management
- `ops_agent/historical_analyzer.py` — Historical context provider
- `ops_agent/digest_generator.py` — EOD digest generation
- `config/ops_settings.py` — v2 configuration
- `persist/ops_agent/regime_history.jsonl` — Regime change history
- `persist/ops_agent/active_watches.jsonl` — Active watches

### 2026-02-09 — Step 4 Phase C: Multi-Agent Constitutional AI Governance

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Severity**: HIGH — Governance layer for AI-driven proposals

#### Phase C Definition

Phase C introduces a **separate governance job** that runs **weekly (Sunday 3:15 AM ET)** during crypto downtime. It analyzes paper and live trading summaries using a **4-agent AI system** and produces **non-binding proposals** that require **human approval** before any changes are applied.

**Critical Architecture Constraint**: Phase C runs **OUTSIDE** trading containers. It has **read-only access** to daily summaries and **ZERO ability** to modify configs, mutate universes, or apply changes automatically.

#### Multi-Agent Architecture

The governance pipeline consists of 4 specialized agents:

1. **Proposer (Agent 1)**: Analyzes trading summaries, identifies opportunities
   - Input: 7 days of daily_summary.jsonl from paper and live scopes
   - Output: Structured proposal with rationale, evidence, confidence
   - Logic: Identifies scan starvation, dead symbols, missed signals
   - Constitutional requirement: `non_binding = True` (always)

2. **Critic (Agent 2)**: Assumes proposal is WRONG (adversarial stance)
   - Input: Proposal from Agent 1
   - Output: Criticisms, counter-evidence, recommendation
   - Logic: Identifies recency bias, overfitting, liquidity risks
   - Recommendation options: PROCEED, CAUTION, REJECT

3. **Auditor (Agent 3)**: Enforces constitutional rules (pure compliance)
   - Input: Proposal from Agent 1
   - Output: Constitutional audit with violations list
   - Logic: Validates proposal_type, non_binding, symbols, limits
   - **ZERO market analysis** — pure format and rule validation
   - Automatic pipeline termination if audit fails

4. **Synthesizer (Agent 4)**: Builds human-readable decision packet
   - Input: Proposal + Critique + Audit
   - Output: Summary, key risks, final recommendation, confidence
   - Logic: Combines all inputs into executive summary
   - Final recommendations: APPROVE, REJECT, DEFER

#### Constitutional Rules (Hard-Coded, Non-Bypassable)

All rules enforced in `governance/constitution.py`:

- **Allowed proposal types**: ADD_SYMBOLS, REMOVE_SYMBOLS, ADJUST_RULE, ADJUST_THRESHOLD
- **Forbidden proposal types**: EXECUTE_TRADE, MODIFY_POSITION, BYPASS_RISK, DISABLE_SAFETY, OVERRIDE_RULE
- **Symbol limits**: Max 5 add per proposal, max 3 remove per proposal
- **Non-binding requirement**: ALL proposals must have `non_binding = True` (constitutional)
- **Forbidden language**: execute, auto-apply, bypass, override, force, disable, skip, inject

#### Scheduling & Execution

- **Frequency**: Weekly (Sunday only)
- **Time**: 3:15 AM ET (8:15 AM UTC) during crypto downtime
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes (4 AI calls + persistence)
- **Entry point**: `governance_main.py --run-once`
- **Execution mode**: Separate job/container (not inside trading)

#### Workflow: Non-Binding Proposal to Approval

```
[Governance Job Runs] → [Read Summaries] → [Agent 1: Propose] → [Agent 2: Critique]
→ [Agent 3: Audit] → [If PASS] → [Agent 4: Synthesize] → [Persist Artifacts]
→ [Log Event] → [EXIT — No Application] → [HUMAN REVIEWS & APPROVES]
```

#### Fail-Safe Guarantees

- **Job fails**: Trading continues unchanged (no retry)
- **No proposal**: Trading continues unchanged
- **Constitutional violation**: Pipeline stops, violation logged
- **No approval**: Trading continues unchanged indefinitely

#### Persistence: Append-Only

```
persist/governance/crypto/proposals/<proposal_id>/
  - proposal.json (Proposer)
  - critique.json (Critic)
  - audit.json (Auditor)
  - synthesis.json (Synthesizer)
  - approval.json (Human approval, if approved)

persist/governance/crypto/logs/
  - governance_events.jsonl (Append-only event log)
```

#### Files Created

**Modules** (10 files):
- `governance/` — Package with __init__.py
- `governance/schemas.py` — Pydantic validation
- `governance/constitution.py` — Constitutional rules
- `governance/persistence.py` — Artifact storage
- `governance/summary_reader.py` — JSONL reader
- `governance/crypto_governance_job.py` — Orchestrator
- `config/governance_settings.py` — Configuration

**Agents** (4 files):
- `governance/agents/proposer.py` — Agent 1
- `governance/agents/critic.py` — Agent 2
- `governance/agents/auditor.py` — Agent 3
- `governance/agents/synthesizer.py` — Agent 4

**Entry point** (1 file):
- `governance_main.py` — CLI

**Tests** (5 files):
- `tests/governance/test_constitution.py`
- `tests/governance/test_proposer.py`
- `tests/governance/test_auditor.py`
- `tests/governance/test_persistence.py`
- `tests/governance/test_governance_job_integration.py`

#### Testing

```bash
# All governance tests
pytest tests/governance/ -v

# Dry-run (read only)
python governance_main.py --dry-run

# Real run
python governance_main.py --run-once
```

#### Hard Constraints

**MUST NOT**:
- Access brokers or executors
- Modify config files automatically
- Hot-reload universes or parameters
- Run inside trading containers

**CAN**:
- Read immutable daily summaries
- Propose changes in structured format
- Enforce constitutional rules
- Generate human-readable reports

#### Quick Start Guide

**Run Dry-Run (Testing, No Persistence)**:
```bash
python governance_main.py --dry-run
```
- Reads summaries
- Runs full 4-agent pipeline
- Does NOT write artifacts
- Safe for testing

**Run Real Job (Full Persistence)**:
```bash
python governance_main.py --run-once
```
- Reads summaries
- Runs full 4-agent pipeline
- Writes artifacts to `persist/governance/crypto/proposals/<id>/`
- Logs events to `governance_events.jsonl`

**Run All Tests**:
```bash
pytest tests/test_governance/ -v
```
- 53 tests
- 100% passing
- Comprehensive coverage of all components

#### Architecture Diagram

```
[Summary Data]
    ↓
[Agent 1: Proposer] → Generates proposal
    ↓
[Agent 2: Critic] → Reviews for risks
    ↓
[Agent 3: Auditor] → Checks constitutional rules (if fails → STOP)
    ↓
[Agent 4: Synthesizer] → Creates human-readable summary
    ↓
[Persist Artifacts] → Write to governance/
    ↓
[EXIT] → No application, waiting for human approval
```

#### Configuration Options

All settings in `config/governance_settings.py`:

```python
GOVERNANCE_ENABLED = True              # Enable/disable job
GOVERNANCE_RUN_TIME_UTC = "08:15"      # 3:15 AM ET
GOVERNANCE_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 7           # Analyze 7 days
MAX_SYMBOLS_ADDED_PER_PROPOSAL = 5    # Limit per proposal
MAX_SYMBOLS_REMOVED_PER_PROPOSAL = 3  # Limit per proposal
PROPOSAL_EXPIRY_HOURS = 72            # Expiry timeout
```

#### Artifact Output Example

**What Gets Written**:
```
persist/governance/crypto/proposals/<proposal_id>/
├── proposal.json           # What Proposer suggests
├── critique.json           # What Critic thinks
├── audit.json              # Constitutional compliance
├── synthesis.json          # Human-readable summary
└── approval.json           # Human approval record (if approved)

persist/governance/crypto/logs/
└── governance_events.jsonl # Event log (append-only)
```

**Example Synthesis Output** (what humans review):
```json
{
  "proposal_id": "abc-123",
  "summary": "Add BTC and ETH to live universe. Paper shows strong signals...",
  "key_risks": [
    "Recency bias from 2-day strong regime",
    "Liquidity concerns for altcoins"
  ],
  "final_recommendation": "DEFER",
  "confidence": 0.65
}
```

#### Container Deployment

**Start Governance Container (24/7)**:
```bash
./run_governance_crypto.sh
```

Container runs continuously:
- ✓ Always running inside Docker
- ✓ Internal scheduler runs job every Sunday 8:15 AM UTC (3:15 AM ET)
- ✓ No host system cron needed
- ✓ Restarts automatically if stopped

**Stop Container**:
```bash
docker stop governance-crypto
```

**View Logs**:
```bash
docker logs -f governance-crypto
```

**Direct Python Execution** (inside container):
```bash
python governance_main.py --daemon      # Run scheduler 24/7
```

**Direct Docker Execution**:
```bash
docker build -t governance-crypto .
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/persist \
  -e GOVERNANCE_ENABLED=true \
  -e PERSISTENCE_ROOT=/app/persist \
  governance-crypto \
  python governance_main.py --run-once
```

**Container Behavior**:
- **Type**: One-time execution (not a daemon)
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes per run
- **Logging**: Console + file-based logging with timestamps

**Log Files**:
```
persist/governance_logs/
└── governance_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log    # Timestamped job logs

persist/governance/crypto/logs/
└── governance_events.jsonl             # Append-only event log
```

#### Core File Locations

**Governance Modules**:
- `governance/` — Main governance package
- `governance/agents/` — 4 agent implementations
- `governance/constitution.py` — Hard-coded rules
- `governance/persistence.py` — Artifact storage
- `governance/summary_reader.py` — Daily summary reader

**Configuration**:
- `config/governance_settings.py` — All settings

**Entry Points**:
- `governance_main.py` — Python CLI (--run-once, --dry-run)
- `run_governance_crypto.sh` — Launcher script (Docker-based execution)

**Tests** (53 tests, 100% passing):
- `tests/test_governance/` — Comprehensive test suite

#### Troubleshooting

**"Governance job found no proposal opportunities"**
- No summaries found in logs
- Check that daily_summary.jsonl exists in:
  - `logs/paper_kraken_crypto_global/logs/daily_summary.jsonl`
  - `logs/live_kraken_crypto_global/logs/daily_summary.jsonl`

**"Constitutional violations detected"**
- Proposal violated hard-coded rules
- Check `violations` field in audit.json
- Common issues: non_binding=false, forbidden proposal type, too many symbols

**Artifacts not written in dry-run**
- Expected behavior! Dry-run intentionally doesn't persist
- Use `--run-once` for real execution

#### Key Design Principles

1. **Separate Execution**: Runs outside trading containers (own job)
2. **Non-Binding**: All proposals require human approval
3. **Read-Only**: No access to brokers or config mutations
4. **Constitutional**: Hard-coded rules enforced in code
5. **Fail-Safe**: If idle, trading continues unchanged
6. **Immutable**: Append-only artifact storage (JSONL)

#### Container Execution Model (Important!)

**The container does NOT keep running continuously.**

```
Sunday 3:15 AM ET (downtime window)
    ↓
[Cron triggers: run_governance_crypto.sh]
    ↓
[Container starts]
    ↓
[Governance job runs: ~5 minutes]
  - Reads summaries (paper + live)
  - Runs 4-agent pipeline
  - Writes artifacts to logs/governance/
  - Logs events
    ↓
[Container exits completely]
    ↓
[Artifacts remain on disk for human review]
    ↓
[You have 72 hours to review and decide]
    ↓
[Proposal expires if no action after 72 hours]
```

**Automatic**: Container starts, runs job, exits (once per week)
**Manual**: You review proposals and decide to approve/reject/defer

#### How to Review & Decide on Proposals

**Step 1: Check for Pending Proposals**
```bash
python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --summary
```

**Step 2: Review Full Details**
```bash
python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --detailed
```

**Step 3: Read the Decision Packet** (most important)
```bash
cat logs/governance/crypto/proposals/<proposal_id>/synthesis.json | jq .
```

Shows: Summary, key risks, final recommendation (APPROVE/REJECT/DEFER), confidence level

**Step 4: (Optional) Read Agent Reasoning**
```bash
cat logs/governance/crypto/proposals/<proposal_id>/proposal.json    # Proposer
cat logs/governance/crypto/proposals/<proposal_id>/critique.json    # Critic
cat logs/governance/crypto/proposals/<proposal_id>/audit.json       # Auditor
```

**Step 5: Make Your Decision**

**Option A - Approve**:
```bash
python governance/approve_proposal.py \
  --approve <proposal_id> \
  --notes "Your reasoning here"
```
Then manually: Edit configs → Commit → Redeploy

**Option B - Reject**:
```bash
python governance/approve_proposal.py \
  --reject <proposal_id> \
  --reason "Why you reject it"
```
Result: Proposal archived, no changes

**Option C - Do Nothing**:
Proposal expires in 72 hours (safe, no harm)

**Recommendations by Confidence**:
- **APPROVE (>70%)**: Confidence high, risks low → Good to apply
- **CAUTION (40-70%)**: Mixed signals → Review carefully
- **DEFER (<40%)**: Uncertainty or low confidence → Wait for more data
- **REJECT**: Significant risks identified → Don't apply

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Does the recommendation make sense?
- [ ] Are key risks actually significant?
- [ ] Recent regime change or solid data?
- [ ] What's the impact if wrong?
- [ ] Do I have enough information to decide?

**Example Timeline**:
```
Sunday 3:15 AM: Governance runs, Proposal created
Monday 9:00 AM: You check, see pending proposal
Tuesday 2:00 PM: You review and APPROVE
Tuesday 2:30 PM: You edit configs and redeploy
Wednesday: New trading runs with approved changes
```

**Important**: Approving a proposal does NOT apply changes automatically. You must:
1. Edit config files
2. Commit to git
3. Redeploy/restart containers
4. Monitor results

#### Approval Decision Support (--defer Option)

In addition to approve/reject, you can also use `--defer`:

```bash
# Defer for more data (same as reject but indicates "wait, don't reject permanently")
python governance/approve_proposal.py \
  --defer <proposal_id> \
  --reason "Need more data, recency bias detected, will re-evaluate next week"
```

All three options (approve/reject/defer) are safe. Governance will re-analyze deferred proposals the following week.

#### Real-World Example: How to Review a Proposal

**Scenario**: Sunday governance runs, creates proposal for paper universe expansion

**Step 1: Check pending**
```bash
$ python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --summary

⚠️  PENDING GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS: 1
Proposal ID: abc-xyz-123-def
Environment: paper
Type: ADD_SYMBOLS
Symbols: DOGE, SHIB, PEPE
Recommendation: CAUTION
Confidence: 58%
```

**Step 2: Read synthesis (the decision packet)**
```bash
$ cat logs/governance/crypto/proposals/abc-xyz-123-def/synthesis.json | jq .

{
  "summary": "Add DOGE, SHIB, PEPE to paper universe...",
  "key_risks": [
    "Recency bias: 2-day PANIC regime surge",
    "Liquidity concerns: PEPE has low volume",
    "Correlation risk: All three symbols are correlated",
    "Scan time: 60% increase in scanning needed"
  ],
  "final_recommendation": "CAUTION",
  "confidence": 0.58
}
```

**Step 3: Your decision making**
- Confidence 58% = moderate, not high
- Recency bias identified = risky
- Liquidity concerns = real downside
- This is paper (safer) but risks are real
- Verdict: **DEFER for more data**

**Step 4: Submit decision**
```bash
$ python governance/approve_proposal.py \
  --defer abc-xyz-123-def \
  --reason "Confidence 58% too low. Recency bias from 2-day surge. Need 1 more week of data before deciding."
```

**Result**: Proposal archived. Governance re-analyzes next week. No changes made. ✅

**Alternative outcome** (if you approved):
1. Create `approval.json` record
2. You manually edit `config/crypto/universe_settings.yaml`
3. You commit and redeploy
4. Trading runs with new symbols next day
5. You monitor: Did signals improve? Did scan time increase? Did recommendations hold?

**Key insight**: The synthesis.json tells you everything. If confidence is low OR risks are high, DEFER is always safe.

#### Quick Decision Reference

| Confidence | Risk Level | Recommendation | Action |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| 80%+ | Low | APPROVE | Edit config → Redeploy |
| 70-80% | Low/Medium | APPROVE | Safe for production |
| 60-70% | Medium | CAUTION → Approve if paper | Test in paper first |
| 50-60% | Medium/High | DEFER | Wait for more data |
| <50% | High | REJECT/DEFER | Skip or wait |

**Golden Rule**: If confidence <70% OR risks seem significant, DEFER. You can always revisit next week with more data.

#### Optional: Check Market Conditions with Adaptive Scheduler

Phase C uses a **static weekly schedule** by default (runs Sunday 3:15 AM ET). However, if you want to check what the current **market mode** would be (for diagnostic purposes), you can use `governance/adaptive_scheduler.py` as an optional utility:

```bash
python governance/adaptive_scheduler.py
```

**Output Example**:
```
================================================================================
ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE SCHEDULER STATUS
================================================================================

Market Conditions:
  Volatility:      MEDIUM
  Max Drawdown:    2.34%
  Missed Signals:  STABLE
  Performance:     STABLE
  Data Quality:    GOOD

Governance Mode: NORMAL
Reason: Market stable: volatility=MEDIUM, performance=STABLE
Next run in: 168 hours (7.0 days)

Mode Meanings:
  NORMAL:    Weekly (calm markets)
  VOLATILE:  Every 3 days (elevated activity)
  REACTIVE:  Every 2 days (market stress)
  EMERGENCY: Daily (crisis mode)
```

**What This Shows**:
- **NORMAL**: Weekly governance (default, current)
- **VOLATILE**: Would run every 3 days if integrated (medium volatility)
- **REACTIVE**: Would run every 2 days if integrated (high volatility, drawdown 5-15%)
- **EMERGENCY**: Would run daily if integrated (extreme volatility, drawdown >15%, or critical performance)

**Note**: This is diagnostic only. Phase C continues to run on weekly schedule. If you want to migrate to dynamic scheduling in the future, `adaptive_scheduler.py` can be integrated into `governance_main.py`, but for now it's useful for understanding current market conditions.

#### Notifications & Monitoring

**NO AUTOMATIC CHANGES**: The governance system will NEVER automatically apply changes. All proposals require your explicit approval.

**Check for Pending Proposals**:
```bash
# Quick summary
python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --summary

# Detailed view
python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --detailed

# Table format
python governance/approve_proposal.py --list
```

**Generate Alerts for Notifications**:
```bash
# Export to text file (for email)
python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --export --output governance_alert.txt

# Export as JSON (for dashboards or Slack)
python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --json --output governance_pending.json
```

**Automated Monitoring Options**:

Option 1 - Daily email alert:
```bash
0 9 * * * cd /app && python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --export --output /tmp/governance_alert.txt && mail -s "Governance Alert" admin@example.com < /tmp/governance_alert.txt
```

Option 2 - Slack webhook:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
PENDING=$(python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --json --output /tmp/pending.json)
COUNT=$(jq '.count' /tmp/pending.json)
if [ $COUNT -gt 0 ]; then
  curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/HERE \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"text\": \"🚨 $COUNT governance proposal(s) pending approval\"}"
fi
```

Option 3 - Dashboard:
```bash
python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --json > /var/www/html/governance_status.json
```

**Full Event History** (append-only):
```bash
cat logs/governance/crypto/logs/governance_events.jsonl
```

Events include:
- GOVERNANCE_PROPOSAL_CREATED
- GOVERNANCE_PROPOSAL_CRITIQUED
- GOVERNANCE_PROPOSAL_AUDITED
- GOVERNANCE_PROPOSAL_SYNTHESIZED
- GOVERNANCE_PROPOSAL_APPROVED (manual)
- GOVERNANCE_PROPOSAL_REJECTED (manual)
- GOVERNANCE_PROPOSAL_EXPIRED (72h no action)

**Proposal Lifecycle** (72-hour window):
```
Week 1 (Sunday 3:15 AM ET)
  ↓
[Governance job runs]
  ↓
[Creates proposal: <id>]
  ↓
[Status: AWAITING APPROVAL]
  ↓
[You check: python governance/check_pending_proposals.py --summary]
  ↓
Week 1-3 (72-hour window)
  ↓
[You can APPROVE, REJECT, or DEFER]
  ↓
If APPROVED:
  ↓
  [You manually edit config/crypto/universe_settings.yaml]
  ↓
  [You git commit and redeploy]

If REJECTED/DEFERRED:
  ↓
  [Proposal archived, no changes]

If NO ACTION:
  ↓
  [After 72 hours: PROPOSAL EXPIRES]
  ↓
  [No changes applied]
```

### 2026-02-08 — Step 4 Phase B: Expanded Universe + Scan Prioritization

**Status**: ✅ IN PROGRESS
**Severity**: MEDIUM — More symbols, same execution safety

#### Phase B Definition

Phase B expands the fixed crypto universe to **10–20 symbols** and uses AI
ranking strictly to **prioritize scan order**. AI remains **advisory only** and
cannot trade, mutate config, or bypass risk controls.

#### What Changed

- **Universe expanded** via explicit `UNIVERSE_ALLOWLIST` in config
- **Scan order** now follows AI ranking (or deterministic fallback)
- **Early scan stop** when capacity is reached (max trades per day or risk block)
- New observability fields:
   - `AI_RANKED_UNIVERSE_SIZE`
   - `AI_SCAN_COVERAGE_COUNT`
   - `SIGNALS_SKIPPED_DUE_TO_CAPACITY`

#### What Did NOT Change (Non‑Negotiable)

- AI never places trades
- AI never mutates config
- AI never bypasses RiskManager or TradePermission
- AI scheduling remains **startup + daily only**
- Failures remain **boring and harmless**
- Trading behavior with AI ON/OFF is **identical** except scan order

#### Example: Early Scan Stop Logs

```
SIGNAL_SKIPPED_DUE_TO_CAPACITY | count=4 symbols=DOT,DOGE,LTC,BCH
CRYPTO_PIPELINE {"stage":"SIGNALS_GENERATED", "scan_order":["BTC","ETH","SOL","LINK","AVAX","ADA","XRP","BCH"], ...}
```

#### Configuration

- `AI_PHASE = "B"`
- `UNIVERSE_ALLOWLIST = ["BTC", "ETH", "SOL", "LINK", "AVAX", "ADA", "XRP", "DOT", "DOGE", "LTC", "BCH"]`
- `MAX_SYMBOLS_SCANNED_PER_CYCLE = 10`

### 2026-02-07 — AI Advisor Scheduling + Full Call Logging

**Status**: ✅ UPDATED
**Severity**: MEDIUM — Observability + deterministic scheduling window

#### Scheduling Change

AI daily ranking now runs **5 minutes before crypto downtime ends** in a
**5‑minute window**, instead of “any time daily.”

- Downtime window defaults to **03:00–05:00 ET** (08:00–10:00 UTC)
- AI daily call window: **04:55–05:00 ET** (09:55–10:00 UTC)

#### Logging Enhancements

AI advisor now logs the **request**, **API call**, **raw response**, and
**reasoning**. It also writes a JSONL audit trail:

- Log lines:
   - `AI_ADVISOR_API_CALL`
   - `AI_ADVISOR_REQUEST`
   - `AI_ADVISOR_RESPONSE`
   - `AI_ADVISOR_REASONING`
- JSONL file:
   - `<scope>/logs/ai_advisor_calls.jsonl`

Each JSONL record includes:
- timestamp
- trigger (startup/daily)
- model + response id
- ranked symbols + reasoning
- raw response payload

#### Files Changed

- `execution/crypto_scheduler.py` (daily task window support)
- `crypto_main.py` (AI call scheduled 5 minutes before downtime end)
- `runtime/ai_advisor.py` (API/response/reasoning logging + JSONL audit)
- `config/crypto_scheduler_settings.py` (default downtime aligned to 03:00–05:00 ET)

### 2026-02-06 — Phase A: AI Advisor (Read-Only Universe Ranking)

**Status**: ✅ MERGED
**Severity**: MEDIUM — Advisory-only ranking (no trading authority)

#### Purpose

Introduces an AI advisor to **rank** a fixed 5‑symbol crypto universe for scan order only.
The AI has **no authority** to trade, change parameters, or alter the universe.

#### Fixed Universe (Mandatory)

AI ranking is limited to:

- BTC
- ETH
- SOL
- LINK
- AVAX

If the configured universe does not match exactly, the pipeline fails fast.

#### Call Frequency Rules (Mandatory)

- **Exactly once at container startup**
- **Once per UTC day** (default 24h interval)
- **Never per tick, per symbol, or per scan**

This prevents accidental loops, controls cost, and keeps AI usage intentional.

#### Behavior

- AI output **reorders scan priority only**
- No symbols are added/removed
- Failures **never block trading** (fallback to default order)
- Call frequency is capped per day and per interval

#### Failure Behavior Guarantees

- Exceptions are caught and logged
- No retries that can loop
- No TradePermission changes
- Trading continues with last known ranking or default order

#### Logging

- `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_TRIGGERED`
- `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_SKIPPED`
- `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_SUCCESS`
- `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_FAILED`

#### Configuration

- `AI_ADVISOR_ENABLED` (default: false)
- `AI_MAX_CALLS_PER_DAY` (default: 1)
- `AI_RANKING_INTERVAL_HOURS` (default: 24)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required when enabled)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (optional override; default: gpt-4o-mini)
- `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` (optional override)

#### Cost & Safety Rationale

- AI calls are **expensive and non‑deterministic**; limiting frequency controls cost.
- Startup + daily cadence avoids runaway loops and keeps behavior observable.
- Health is tracked **without external API pings**.

#### Validation Utilities (Non‑Production)

**A) Scheduler Skip Validation (No API Call)**

Run with `AI_VALIDATE_SCHEDULER=true`. This executes the scheduler decision once,
logs a single `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_SKIPPED` reason, and exits without calling OpenAI.

Expected log lines:

- `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_TRIGGERED | trigger=validation ...`
- `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_SKIPPED | ... reason=disabled|interval_limit|max_calls_reached|validation_mode_no_call`

**B) Failure Simulation (OPENAI_API_KEY unset)**

Start the live container with `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset (or empty). Expected:

- `AI_ADVISOR_RANKING_FAILED | ... error=missing_api_key`
- Trading continues normally
- Scan order falls back to cached/default
- TradePermission unchanged

#### Files Changed

- `runtime/ai_advisor.py` (new)
- `prompts/universe_ranking_phase_a.txt` (new)
- `crypto/pipeline/crypto_pipeline.py`
- `config/crypto_scheduler_settings.py`
- `runtime/observability.py`
- `config/crypto/*.yaml`

### 2026-02-06 — Operational Observability (Live Crypto)

**Status**: ✅ MERGED
**Severity**: HIGH — Live auditability and explainability

#### Purpose

Adds two explicit observability artifacts:

1. **Live status snapshot** (human‑readable)
2. **Daily immutable summary** (machine‑readable JSONL)

#### Live Status Snapshot

Emitted on:
- Startup success
- Block entry/clearance
- Every N minutes (configurable)

Format:

```
================ LIVE STATUS =================
ENV: LIVE
BROKER: KRAKEN
MARKET: GLOBAL
TRADING_ALLOWED: YES
ACTIVE_BLOCK_STATE: NONE
BLOCK_REASON: NONE
MARKET_DATA_STATUS: FRESH
RECONCILIATION_STATUS: OK
AI_ENABLED: YES
AI_CALLS_TODAY: 0
AI_LAST_CALL_TIME: NONE
AI_LAST_SUCCESS_TIME: NONE
AI_LAST_ERROR: NONE
OPEN_POSITIONS: 0
DAILY_PNL: 0.00
LAST_TRADE_TIMESTAMP: NONE
UPTIME_SECONDS: 120
=============================================
```

#### Daily Immutable Summary (JSONL)

Written **once per UTC day** to an append‑only JSONL file.
No overwrites. Duplicate writes are rejected with error logs.

Example record:

```json
{
   "date": "2026-02-06",
   "env": "live",
   "broker": "kraken",
   "uptime_seconds": 86400,

   "ai_last_call_time": null,
   "ai_last_success_time": null,
   "ai_last_error": null,
   "ai_last_ranking": null
}
```

#### Configuration

- `STATUS_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default: 15)
- `DAILY_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_PATH` (default: <scope>/logs/daily_summary.jsonl)

#### Operational Guidance

- Snapshot is for **human inspection** in logs
- Summary is for **audit, compliance, and ML analysis**
- Startup failure exits the container; runtime blocks keep it alive but refuse trades

#### Files Changed

- `runtime/observability.py` (new)
- `runtime/trade_permission.py`
- `crypto_main.py`
- `execution/crypto_scheduler.py`
- `data/crypto_price_loader.py`
- `core/data/providers/kraken_provider.py`
- `broker/trading_executor.py`

### 2026-02-06 — Runtime NO-TRADE States (Live Kraken Crypto)

**Status**: ✅ MERGED
**Severity**: CRITICAL — Runtime trade safety (fail-closed without crashes)

#### Purpose

Live trading must continue running **without placing orders** when safety policy blocks it.
This introduces explicit runtime NO-TRADE states that veto trading by policy (not exceptions).

#### Block States (Canonical)

1. **MARKET_DATA_BLOCKED**
   - OHLC stale or unavailable
   - Anchor symbol (BTC) regime candles missing
   - >50% of universe symbols failed to fetch data
   - Note: 1-2 non-anchor symbol failures trigger `MARKET_DATA_PARTIAL` (graceful degradation) instead of a full block

2. **RECONCILIATION_BLOCKED**
   - Broker open positions mismatch ledger

3. **RISK_LIMIT_BLOCKED**
   - Daily loss limit hit
   - Max trades/day hit
   - Portfolio heat exceeded
   - Per-symbol exposure exceeded

4. **MANUAL_HALT**
   - Operator kill switch (`MANUAL_HALT=true`)

#### Behavior

- **Scheduler keeps running** (monitoring + reconciliation continue)
- **Trading decisions are vetoed** with explicit logs
- **No restarts required**
- **No silent skips**

#### Logging (Required)

- Enter block: `TRADING_BLOCKED_<STATE>`
- Skip trade: `TRADE_SKIPPED_<STATE>`
- Clear block: `TRADING_UNBLOCKED_<STATE>`

Each log includes **state**, **reason**, and **timestamp**.

#### Startup Failure vs Runtime Block

- **Startup failure**: container exits immediately
- **Runtime block**: container stays up, trading is vetoed

#### Status Snapshot

Runtime snapshot is emitted each tick:

```
ENV: LIVE
BROKER: KRAKEN
TRADING_ALLOWED: YES | NO
BLOCK_STATE: <STATE or NONE>
BLOCK_REASON: <reason or NONE>
LAST_BLOCK_CHANGE: <timestamp>
```

#### Clearing Blocks Safely

- **Manual halt** cleared only by operator (`MANUAL_HALT=false`)
- **Market data** cleared only after fresh OHLC verified
- **Reconciliation** cleared only after broker/ledger re-verified
- **Risk limits** cleared only when limits reset by policy

#### Files Changed

- `runtime/trade_permission.py` (new)
- `broker/trading_executor.py` (trade gate + risk block)
- `data/crypto_price_loader.py` (market data block + clear)
- `crypto/pipeline/crypto_pipeline.py` (graceful degradation: anchor check, >50% threshold, partial trading)
- `execution/runtime.py` (reconciliation block)

---

### 2026-02-06 — CRITICAL: Live Kraken Crypto Startup Safety Gate (Fail-Closed)

**Status**: ✅ MERGED
**Severity**: CRITICAL — Live trading safety gate

#### Summary

Added a strict two-layer startup verification for `live_kraken_crypto_global`:

1. **Shell-level preflight** in `run_live_kraken_crypto.sh`
2. **Python-level gate** in `crypto_main.py` (before scheduler init)

If ANY check fails, the container exits immediately. No retries. No fallbacks.

#### Shell-Level Checks (run_live_kraken_crypto.sh)

- ENV = live
- BROKER = kraken
- MODE = crypto
- MARKET = crypto/global
- PAPER_TRADING = false
- LIVE_TRADING_APPROVED = true
- Downtime window format validated (HH:MM, start != end)
- Kraken API key + secret present

Failure behavior: prints ERROR banner and exits non-zero **before** container start.

#### Python-Level Checks (verify_live_startup_or_exit)

**A. Environment invariants**: ENV/BROKER/MODE/MARKET/PAPER_TRADING/LIVE_TRADING_APPROVED

**B. Kraken API + permissions**:
- Authenticated call succeeds
- OpenOrders permission works
- Withdrawal permission must be disabled (verified by `WithdrawInfo` permission-denied)
- Margin positions blocked unless explicitly approved

**C. Balance sanity**:
- Balances readable
- No negative balances
- Total equity >= 0

**D. OHLC freshness**:
- Live startup fetches 5m + 4h OHLC
- Zero staleness tolerance
- If anchor symbol (BTC) OHLC unavailable ⇒ `MARKET_DATA_BLOCKED` and exit
- If >50% of universe OHLC unavailable ⇒ `MARKET_DATA_BLOCKED` and exit
- If 1-2 non-anchor symbols fail ⇒ graceful degradation (trade healthy subset)

**E. External reconciliation**:
- Kraken open positions must match local ledger
- Any mismatch ⇒ `RECONCILIATION_BLOCKED` and exit

**F. RiskManager init**:
- Valid risk settings
- RiskManager initializes successfully

#### Logging Requirement

Startup emits exactly one terminal event:
- `LIVE_STARTUP_VERIFIED`
- or `LIVE_STARTUP_FAILED_<REASON>`

#### Files Changed

- `run_live_kraken_crypto.sh` (strict shell preflight)
- `crypto_main.py` (verify_live_startup_or_exit)

### 2026-02-06 — CRITICAL FIX: Kraken OHLC Staleness Guard (Live & Paper)

**Status**: ✅ MERGED
**Severity**: CRITICAL — Data correctness (stale market data)

#### Root Cause

Kraken OHLC cache was used whenever a cache file existed and had “enough rows.”
There was **no staleness validation**, so both paper and live could trade on outdated candles.

#### Fix Summary

1. **Explicit staleness check** using last candle timestamp vs current UTC time.
2. **Live mode is strict**: zero tolerance beyond the current candle.
3. **Paper mode allows tolerance** (configurable, default = interval + 2 candles).
4. **Truthful logging** for every OHLC decision:
    - `OHLC_CACHE_HIT_FRESH`
    - `OHLC_CACHE_STALE_REFRESH`
    - `OHLC_API_FETCH`
5. **Fail-safe for live**: if fresh OHLC cannot be obtained, trading is blocked for that tick (`MARKET_DATA_BLOCKED`).
6. **Atomic cache writes** to prevent partial/corrupt cache files.

#### New Config Flags

- `ENABLE_OHLC_CACHE` (default: true)
- `MAX_OHLC_STALENESS_SECONDS`
   - **Live**: `0` (no extra tolerance beyond current candle)
   - **Paper**: `"auto"` (interval + 2 candles)

#### Files Changed

- `core/data/providers/kraken_provider.py`
   - Added staleness validation, strict live blocking, required OHLC logs
   - Added atomic cache writes
- `data/crypto_price_loader.py`
   - Plumbed `ENABLE_OHLC_CACHE` and `MAX_OHLC_STALENESS_SECONDS`
- `config/crypto/live.kraken.crypto.global.yaml`
   - `ENABLE_OHLC_CACHE=true`, `MAX_OHLC_STALENESS_SECONDS=0`
- `config/crypto/paper.kraken.crypto.global.yaml`
   - `ENABLE_OHLC_CACHE=true`, `MAX_OHLC_STALENESS_SECONDS="auto"`

#### Migration Notes

Live trading now **refuses to proceed** if OHLC data is stale or fetch fails.
Paper trading remains permissive but no longer silently uses stale caches.

### 2026-02-05 — CRITICAL FIX: ML Orchestration Gating & Truthful Logging

**Status**: ✅ MERGED (Commit `23f7dc7`)  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Truthfulness  

#### Problem

ML training logs "completed" unconditionally, even with 0 trades.

#### Solution

Three-gate eligibility system with truthful event logging:

| Gate | Check | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| Gate 1 | Paper-only | Live mode: blocked |
| Gate 2 | Trade data | 0 trades: SKIP + log |
| Gate 3 | Orchestrator | Not implemented: SKIP + cite |

#### Logging Events

- `ML_TRAINING_SKIPPED | reason=no_trades_available` — Current state (0 trades)
- `ML_TRAINING_SKIPPED | reason=ml_orchestrator_not_implemented` — ML not ready
- `ML_TRAINING_START` → `ML_TRAINING_COMPLETED | model_version=...` — When ML ready

**CRITICAL**: COMPLETED only logged when artifacts actually written.

#### Changes

- `crypto_main.py`: Three-gate system + structured logging (lines 100-175)
- `tests/crypto/test_crypto_ml_orchestration.py`: 6 comprehensive tests
- Removed dead code and TODO comments

#### Guarantees

✅ Never logs COMPLETED without work  
✅ Matches swing scheduler.py pattern  
✅ Paper-only enforcement  
✅ Graceful degradation  
✅ 100% backward compatible

### 2026-02-05 — Crypto Regime Engine ACTIVE (5m Execution / 4h Regime)

**Scope**: Crypto-only (paper_kraken_crypto_global, live_kraken_crypto_global)  
**Audience**: Engineer / Quant Research / Trading Ops  

**Status**: ✅ Active — Two-timeframe candle model, real regime engine, strategy gating, full pipeline logs

#### Summary

Crypto trading now runs a **real regime engine** using **4h candles**, while strategies use **5m candles**. The pipeline is deterministic, crypto-only, and emits structured stage logs at every step.

**Explicit statement**: **Crypto regime engine is ACTIVE.**

#### Two-Timeframe Design (MANDATORY)

- **Execution candles (5m)** → Strategy signals
- **Regime candles (4h)** → Regime detection ONLY

No mixing. 5m candles never feed the regime engine; 4h candles never feed strategy signals.

#### Regime Logic (Configurable)

All thresholds are configurable in crypto config files:

- Volatility: `REGIME_VOL_LOW`, `REGIME_VOL_HIGH`, `REGIME_VOL_EXTREME`
- Trend: `REGIME_TREND_POS`, `REGIME_TREND_NEG`, `REGIME_TREND_STRONG_NEG`
- Drawdown: `REGIME_DRAWDOWN_MILD`, `REGIME_DRAWDOWN_MODERATE`, `REGIME_DRAWDOWN_SEVERE`
- Hysteresis: `REGIME_HYSTERESIS_COUNT` (consecutive confirmations)

#### Pipeline Order (Crypto)

**Data → Feature Builder → Regime Engine → Strategy Selector → Signals → Risk → Execution → Broker → Reconciliation → Cycle Summary**

#### Example Logs (Structured)

### 2026-02-05 — Alpaca Reconciliation V2 Integration Complete

**Scope**: Broker / Account Reconciliation / Production Deployment  
**Audience**: Engineer / Trading Operations  

**Status**: ✅ Complete — Feature flag integration, timestamp hardening, comprehensive tests, production runbook

#### Summary

Integrated AlpacaReconciliationEngine (alpaca_v2) into live swing trading AccountReconciler with safe rollout via feature flag. Prevents timestamp/qty mismatch bugs by making broker fills the source of truth. Legacy reconciliation path hardened to warn about datetime.now() fallback. Full test coverage added for both legacy and alpaca_v2 engines.

#### Integration Changes

**File**: `config/settings.py`
- Added `RECONCILIATION_ENGINE` feature flag (default: "alpaca_v2")
- Values: "legacy" (old backfill logic, has datetime.now() bug) | "alpaca_v2" (new engine, broker fills as truth)
- Controlled via environment variable: `RECONCILIATION_ENGINE=legacy` to rollback if needed

**File**: `broker/account_reconciliation.py`
- Added `state_dir` parameter to `__init__()` (required for alpaca_v2)
- Integrated AlpacaReconciliationEngine as Step 0 in `reconcile_on_startup()`
- Logs engine selection at startup: "Reconciliation Engine: legacy" or "alpaca_v2"
- Fails startup if alpaca_v2 engine fails (prevents trading with stale state)

**File**: `broker/trade_ledger.py`
- Hardened `backfill_broker_position()` to reject `entry_timestamp=None` when `RECONCILIATION_ENGINE=alpaca_v2`
- Raises `ValueError` with clear message directing to AlpacaReconciliationEngine
- Legacy mode: allows fallback to `datetime.now()` but logs warning about date drift

**File**: `tests/broker/test_reconciliation_integration.py` (NEW)
- 8 test classes, 13 tests total
- Tests feature flag switching, broker timestamp usage, qty matching
- Tests idempotency, atomic writes, timestamp hardening
- Tests startup logging and duplicate prevention

#### Deployment Runbook

**Enable Alpaca V2 Engine**

✅ **Already enabled by default!** No action needed.

1. **Verify it's active** (check logs):
   ```bash
   docker logs live-alpaca-swing-us | grep "Reconciliation Engine"
   # Should show: Reconciliation Engine: alpaca_v2
   ```

**Rollback to Legacy** (if issues arise)

Only if you need to revert to old behavior:

1. **Set environment variable** (Docker, systemd, or shell):
   ```bash
   export RECONCILIATION_ENGINE=legacy
   ```

2. **Restart container**:
   ```bash
   bash run_us_live_swing.sh
   ```

3. **Verify rollback in logs**:
   ```
   Reconciliation Engine: legacy
   ```

**Monitoring**

Watch for these log patterns:

- **Success (alpaca_v2)**: `✓ Alpaca v2 reconciliation complete`
- **Success (legacy)**: `Reconciliation Engine: legacy`
- **Failure (alpaca_v2)**: `CRITICAL: Alpaca v2 reconciliation failed`
- **Timestamp warning (legacy)**: `TIMESTAMP FALLBACK: Backfilling.*datetime.now()`

**Expected Behavior**

| Engine | Timestamp Source | Idempotent | Atomic Writes | Cursor |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| legacy | datetime.now() fallback | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| alpaca_v2 | Broker fill timestamps | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

**Validation Checklist**

After enabling alpaca_v2:

- [ ] Startup logs show `Reconciliation Engine: alpaca_v2`
- [ ] No `TIMESTAMP FALLBACK` warnings
- [ ] Open positions match broker exactly
- [ ] Entry timestamps are UTC ISO-8601 with Z suffix (e.g., `2026-02-05T20:55:55Z`)
- [ ] State files exist:
  - `open_positions.json`
  - `reconciliation_cursor.json`
- [ ] No duplicate positions on subsequent reconciliations
- [ ] Running reconciliation twice produces identical state

**Troubleshooting**

**Issue**: `ValueError: state_dir required when RECONCILIATION_ENGINE=alpaca_v2`
- **Fix**: Pass `state_dir` parameter to AccountReconciler init

**Issue**: `AlpacaReconciliationEngine not initialized`
- **Fix**: Verify RECONCILIATION_ENGINE env var is set and state_dir exists

**Issue**: `Cannot backfill position.*entry_timestamp=None.*alpaca_v2`
- **Fix**: Do not call backfill_broker_position with None timestamp. Let alpaca_v2 engine handle reconciliation.

**Issue**: Timestamp still shows Feb 04 instead of Feb 05
- **Fix**: Verify RECONCILIATION_ENGINE=alpaca_v2 (check logs). If using legacy, enable alpaca_v2.

#### Test Results

**Integration Tests**: `tests/broker/test_reconciliation_integration.py`
- Test feature flag switching: ✅ PASS
- Test alpaca_v2 uses broker fill timestamps: ✅ PASS
- Test qty matches broker: ✅ PASS
- Test idempotent reconciliation: ✅ PASS
- Test atomic writes: ✅ PASS
- Test timestamp hardening (rejects None in alpaca_v2): ✅ PASS
- Test startup logging: ✅ PASS
- Test no duplicate buys: ✅ PASS

**Existing Tests**: All existing tests pass (no regressions)

#### Files Changed

- **Modified**: config/settings.py (+5 lines: RECONCILIATION_ENGINE flag)
- **Modified**: broker/account_reconciliation.py (+80 lines: integration, logging, state_dir)
- **Modified**: broker/trade_ledger.py (+20 lines: timestamp hardening)
- **New**: tests/broker/test_reconciliation_integration.py (430 lines: 13 tests)

#### Production Status

✅ READY FOR GRADUAL ROLLOUT
- Feature flag allows safe A/B testing
- Legacy path unchanged (backward compatible)
- Alpaca_v2 path hardened against None timestamps
- Full test coverage (integration + unit)
- Clear logs show active engine
- Fast rollback via env var

**Recommended Rollout**:
1. Deploy with `RECONCILIATION_ENGINE=alpaca_v2` (NEW DEFAULT - already enabled!)
2. Monitor logs for 24h: `docker logs -f live-alpaca-swing-us | grep "Alpaca v2 reconciliation"`
3. Verify entry timestamps are UTC with Z suffix
4. Confirm qty matches broker exactly
5. If stable after 48h, nothing else needed - system is running with fix
6. If issues: set `RECONCILIATION_ENGINE=legacy` and redeploy to rollback

### 2026-02-05 — Alpaca Live Swing Reconciliation Fix Complete

**Scope**: Broker / Account Reconciliation / Live Trading State  
**Audience**: Engineer / Trading Operations  

**Status**: ✅ Complete — 12/12 tests passing, UTC timestamps fixed, qty mismatch resolved, atomic persistence implemented

#### Summary

Fixed critical data sync bug where live swing trader's local ledger was out of sync with Alpaca broker. Broker showed fills on Feb 05, 3:55 PM ET, but local state incorrectly recorded them as Feb 04. Implemented robust reconciliation with UTC timestamp normalization, atomic persistence, idempotent state rebuild, and cursor tracking.

#### Problems Resolved

1. **Timezone truncation bug** - Feb 05 fills recorded as Feb 04 (entry_timestamp date-only)
2. **Qty mismatch** - Broker: 0.130079109 vs Local: 0.085073456 (missing today's fill)
3. **Non-idempotent reconciliation** - Re-running could duplicate fills
4. **Non-atomic persistence** - Partial writes could corrupt state files
5. **No fill cursor** - Always re-fetched from start, inefficient and error-prone

#### Implementation

**New Module**: `broker/alpaca_reconciliation.py` (530 lines)
- `AlpacaFill`: Normalized fill from Alpaca API (fill_id, order_id, symbol, qty, price, filled_at_utc, side)
- `LocalOpenPosition`: Open position computed from fills (symbol, entry_timestamp, entry_price, entry_qty)
- `ReconciliationCursor`: Durable cursor (last_seen_fill_id, last_seen_fill_time_utc) for incremental fetches
- `AlpacaReconciliationState`: In-memory state manager with atomic persistence
- `AlpacaReconciliationEngine`: Orchestrates fetch → rebuild → persist cycle

**Test Suite**: `tests/broker/test_alpaca_reconciliation.py` (330 lines, 12/12 passing)
- 3 tests: UTC timestamp normalization (no truncation, Feb 05 stays Feb 05)
- 5 tests: State rebuild from fills (idempotent, handles buy/sell, weighted avg price)
- 2 tests: Atomic write (temp file → fsync → rename)
- 2 tests: Idempotency (running reconciliation 2x = identical state)

**Demo Script**: `broker/alpaca_reconciliation_demo.py` (150 lines)
- Simulates real scenario (Feb 02, 03, 05 fills from Alpaca)
- Shows correct UTC timestamps after reconciliation
- Validates qty matches broker (0.13007910 == 0.13007910)
- Proves Feb 05 preserved (not truncated to Feb 04)

#### Key Fixes

**Fix #1: UTC Timestamp Normalization**
```
Before (BROKEN):
  entry_timestamp = datetime.now().date()  # Date-only, loses time!
  Result: "2026-02-04" (wrong date, no time)

After (FIXED):
  entry_timestamp = fill.filled_at_utc  # ISO-8601 with Z
  Result: "2026-02-05T20:55:55Z" (correct date and time, UTC)
```

**Fix #2: Idempotent State Rebuild from Fills**
- Group fills by symbol
- Calculate net qty = sum(buy.qty) - sum(sell.qty)
- Entry: first buy (time + price), Weighted avg price from all buys
- Last entry: most recent buy
- Property: rebuild([f1,f2,f3]) = rebuild([f1,f2,f3]) = State A (idempotent)

**Fix #3: Atomic Persistence**
- Write to temp file → fsync() → atomic rename()
- If crash during write: temp cleaned up, target unchanged
- Guarantees: state file never in partial/corrupted state

**Fix #4: Cursor Tracking for Incremental Fetch**
- Cursor persisted to reconciliation_cursor.json (last_fill_id, last_fill_time_utc)
- Fetch fills since cursor - 24h (safety window for retries)

```

#### Integration

To activate in production, add to `AccountReconciler.reconcile_on_startup()`:
```python
from broker.alpaca_reconciliation import AlpacaReconciliationEngine

engine = AlpacaReconciliationEngine(
    broker_adapter=self.broker,
    state_dir=Path(ledger_dir) / "reconciliation"
)
result = engine.reconcile_from_broker()

if result["status"] != "OK":
    logger.error(f"Reconciliation failed: {result}")
    self.safe_mode = True
```

Periodic reconciliation (every 5-15 min) with qty mismatch guard to prevent duplicate buys.

### 2026-02-05 — Crypto 24/7 Daemon Scheduler Complete

**Scope**: Execution / Scheduling / Crypto Operations  
**Audience**: Engineer / Deployment  

**Status**: ✅ Complete — 24/24 tests passing (11 new scheduler tests + 13 existing downtime tests), zero breaking changes, production-ready

#### Summary

Transformed crypto trading from batch mode ("one run, then exit") to production-grade 24/7 daemon with persistent scheduler state, daily ML downtime window (UTC, configurable), and zero swing scheduler contamination. Matches swing-style robustness while maintaining complete isolation.

#### Problems Resolved

1. **Batch mode execution** - Crypto ran once and exited (unlike swing daemon mode)
2. **No persistent state** - Tasks could rerun after container restart
3. **Contamination risk** - No guardrails preventing accidental swing scheduler sharing
4. **Missing downtime enforcement** - No daily ML training window enforcement
5. **No task scheduling framework** - Ad-hoc task execution without structure

#### Implementation

**New Modules** (5 files, ~1,190 lines code + ~430 lines tests):
- `execution/crypto_scheduler.py` (200 lines) - Main daemon orchestrator with `CryptoScheduler` class, signal handlers for graceful shutdown, and `CryptoSchedulerTask` framework for interval/daily task definitions
- `crypto/scheduling/state.py` (250 lines) - Persistent state manager with `CryptoSchedulerState` class, JSON file persistence with atomic writes (temp → rename), and **CRITICAL** `_validate_crypto_only_path()` method enforcing zero swing contamination
- `crypto_main.py` (280 lines) - Entry point for 24/7 daemon mode (replaces batch `python main.py`), task definitions for trading_tick, monitor, ml_training, reconciliation
- `config/crypto_scheduler_settings.py` (30 lines) - Crypto-only scheduler configuration, all environment-driven, separate from swing settings
- `tests/crypto/test_crypto_scheduler.py` (430 lines) - 11 comprehensive tests: 5 mandatory (A-E) validating state persistence, downtime enforcement, daily idempotency, and zero contamination + 6 robustness tests

**Modified Files** (4 files):
- `crypto/scheduling/__init__.py` - Added imports for new `CryptoSchedulerState` and `CryptoScheduler` classes, preserved existing `DowntimeScheduler`
- `README.md` - Added "Crypto 24/7 Daemon" quickstart section, updated status to Phase 1.2 ✅, documented configuration options
- `run_paper_kraken_crypto.sh` - Changed entrypoint from `python main.py` to `python crypto_main.py`, added environment variables for downtime window configuration
- `run_live_kraken_crypto.sh` - Same changes as paper script + API credential verification

#### Architecture

**Daemon Loop**:
- `while True` event loop in `CryptoScheduler.run_forever()` (vs batch mode exit)
- 60-second scheduler tick (configurable via `CRYPTO_SCHEDULER_TICK_SECONDS`)
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT with final state persistence

**Task Scheduling Framework**:
- `CryptoSchedulerTask`: Task definition (name, callable, interval minutes, daily flag, allowed trading state)
- `should_run()`: Checks if task due based on elapsed time and trading state
- Supports interval-based (e.g., every 1 minute) and daily (once per day) task types
- Task state machine respects `DowntimeScheduler`: blocks trading 03:00-05:00 UTC (default), allows ML training only during downtime

**Persistent State**:
- JSON file at `/app/persist/<scope>/state/crypto_scheduler_state.json`
- Maps task name → ISO UTC timestamp of last execution
- Atomic writes via temp file → rename pattern (prevents corruption)
- Survives container restart: daily tasks skip if already run same day

**Contamination Prevention**:
- `_validate_crypto_only_path()` raises ValueError if path contains "swing", "alpaca", "ibkr", "zerodha"
- Enforced at `CryptoSchedulerState.__init__()` before any operations
- Crypto-only path must contain "crypto" or "kraken" keyword
- Fails fast on startup with clear error message

#### Configuration

All environment-driven (no code changes needed):
- `CRYPTO_DOWNTIME_START_UTC="03:00"` (default, HH:MM format)
- `CRYPTO_DOWNTIME_END_UTC="05:00"` (default, HH:MM format)
- `CRYPTO_SCHEDULER_TICK_SECONDS=60` (main event loop interval)
- `CRYPTO_TRADING_TICK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=1` (trading execution interval)
- `CRYPTO_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15` (exit monitoring interval)
- `CRYPTO_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MINUTES=60` (account reconciliation interval)

#### Task Definitions

| Task | Interval | Allowed During | Purpose |
|------|----------|---|---------|
| `trading_tick` | Every 1 min | Trading window | Execute full trading pipeline |
| `monitor` | Every 15 min | Anytime | Check exits (emergency + EOD), no new signals |
| `ml_training` | Once daily | Downtime only | Run daily ML training cycle (paper only) |
| `reconciliation` | Every 60 min | Anytime | Sync account with broker |

#### Test Results

- **Mandatory Tests (A-E)**: 5/5 PASSING ✅
  - A) `test_crypto_scheduler_persists_state`: State survives restart ✅
  - B) `test_crypto_downtime_blocks_trading_allows_ml`: Downtime enforcement ✅
  - C) `test_crypto_outside_downtime_allows_trading_blocks_ml`: Trading window ✅
  - D) `test_crypto_daily_task_runs_once_per_day_even_after_restart`: Daily idempotency ✅
  - E) `test_scheduler_state_is_crypto_only`: Zero contamination enforcement ✅
- **Robustness Tests**: 6/6 PASSING ✅
- **Existing Downtime Tests**: 13/13 PASSING ✅ (no regression)
- **Total**: 24/24 PASSING ✅

#### Validation

**Syntax & Compilation**: ✅ All new files pass `python -m py_compile`

**Production Readiness**:
- ✅ 24/7 continuous operation (while True loop)
- ✅ Persistent state (JSON, atomic writes)
- ✅ Daily downtime window (UTC, configurable)
- ✅ ML training only during downtime (enforced)
- ✅ Trading paused during downtime (enforced)
- ✅ Zero swing contamination (path validation)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging (each tick logged)

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Paper daemon:
bash run_paper_kraken_crypto.sh

# Live daemon (requires API credentials):
KRAKEN_API_KEY="..." KRAKEN_API_SECRET="..." bash run_live_kraken_crypto.sh

# Monitor:
docker logs -f paper-kraken-crypto-global

# Stop gracefully:
docker stop paper-kraken-crypto-global
```

### 2026-02-05 — Crypto Scope Contamination Fixes Complete

**Scope**: Data Providers / Market Data / Reconciliation  
**Audience**: Engineer / Deployment  

**Status**: ✅ Complete — All 6 tests passing, zero Phase 0/1 regressions, clean startup logs

#### Summary

Fixed critical contamination in paper_kraken_crypto_global (and live.kraken.crypto.global) data + reconciliation flows. Achieved 100% crypto-native architecture with ZERO swing/equity/Alpaca contamination. Paper crypto no longer loads SPY/QQQ/IWM via yfinance or reconciles with Alpaca.

#### Problems Resolved

1. **Equity symbols in crypto scope** - Paper crypto loaded SPY/QQQ/IWM via legacy screener instead of BTC/ETH/SOL
2. **Wrong data source** - Used yfinance (equity-focused) instead of Kraken for market data
3. **Alpaca fallback in crypto reconciliation** - Reconciliation queried Alpaca under Kraken crypto scope (violated scope isolation)
4. **No guardrails** - No fail-fast checks to prevent future contamination

#### Implementation

**New Modules** (6 files, 510 lines):
- `config/crypto/loader.py` (90 lines) - Parse lightweight key=value crypto config files (YAML-like without full YAML)
- `crypto/scope_guard.py` (90 lines) - Enforce crypto scope invariants, fail fast on contamination. Main function: `enforce_crypto_scope_guard(scope, broker, scope_paths)` validates provider=KRAKEN, symbols in CryptoUniverse, broker != Alpaca
- `core/data/providers/kraken_provider.py` (220 lines) - Kraken REST OHLC market data provider. Class: `KrakenMarketDataProvider` with `fetch_ohlcv(canonical_symbol, lookback_days)` method. Uses urllib.request (no external deps), returns OHLCV DataFrames, deterministic CSV caching under dataset/ohlcv/
- `data/crypto_price_loader.py` (45 lines) - Crypto-specific price loader routing to KrakenMarketDataProvider. Validates MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER=="KRAKEN" in config and symbol in CryptoUniverse
- `broker/crypto_reconciliation.py` (65 lines) - Crypto account reconciliation (Kraken-only). Class: `CryptoAccountReconciler` with `reconcile_on_startup()`. Gracefully handles NotImplementedError with RECONCILIATION_UNAVAILABLE_CRYPTO_ADAPTER_STUB warning
- `tests/crypto/test_crypto_scope_guardrails.py` (160 lines) - 6 comprehensive guardrail tests validating contamination prevention

**Modified Files** (6 files):
- `config/crypto/paper.kraken.crypto.global.yaml` - Added MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER="KRAKEN", KRAKEN_OHLC_INTERVAL="1d", ENABLE_WS_MARKETDATA=false
- `config/crypto/live.kraken.crypto.global.yaml` - Same config additions
- `core/data/providers/__init__.py` - Exported KrakenMarketDataProvider
- `data/price_loader.py` - Added fail-fast guard for crypto scopes (raises ValueError if called under crypto scope, routes to crypto_price_loader instead)
- `execution/runtime.py` - Added enforce_crypto_scope_guard() call after broker instantiation, added conditional reconciliation routing (CryptoAccountReconciler for crypto, AccountReconciler for others)
- `main.py` - Added scope-aware routing functions (_is_crypto_scope, _get_symbols_for_scope, _load_price_data_for_scope). Modified main() loop to use crypto routing when appropriate

#### Architecture

**Scope-Aware Routing**:
- Runtime inspection of scope.mode and scope.broker determines data provider
- Config-driven via MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER setting in crypto/*.yaml
- Fail-fast guard called during runtime.build_paper_trading_runtime() before any trading logic

**Data Provider Enforcement**:
- Kraken REST OHLC endpoint: `/0/public/OHLC?pair=XXBTZUSD&interval=1440`
- Returns OHLCV DataFrame with Date (UTC), Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- Cached deterministically under dataset/ohlcv/<symbol>_<interval>.csv
- No external dependencies (urllib.request only)

**Reconciliation Routing**:
- CryptoAccountReconciler used for crypto scopes (queries broker.account_equity, broker.buying_power, broker.get_positions())
- AccountReconciler used for swing scopes
- No Alpaca fallback under crypto scopes

**Guard Enforcement**:
- Checks: provider == "KRAKEN", symbols in CryptoUniverse (BTC/ETH/SOL), broker != Alpaca, scope string contains "crypto"
- Raises ValueError with clear error message on any contamination
- Called during broker initialization before any trading operations

#### Test Results

- **Crypto scope guardrail tests: 6/6 PASSING** ✅
  - test_crypto_scope_never_uses_yfinance ✅
  - test_crypto_scope_rejects_equity_symbols ✅
  - test_crypto_scope_never_instantiates_alpaca ✅
  - test_kraken_market_data_provider_uses_ohlc_endpoint ✅
  - test_reconciliation_uses_kraken_only ✅
  - test_crypto_scope_guard_enforces_provider_and_universe ✅
- **Phase 0 regression tests: 24/24 PASSING** ✅
- **Phase 1 regression tests: 18/18 PASSING** ✅
- **Total: 48/48 PASSING**

#### Validation

**Startup Logs** (paper_kraken_crypto_global):
```
crypto_scope_guard passed provider=KRAKEN symbols=['BTC', 'ETH', 'SOL'] broker=KrakenAdapter
Broker: KrakenAdapter
6 crypto strategies instantiated (long_term_trend_follower, volatility_scaled_swing, mean_reversion, defensive_hedge_short, cash_stable_allocator, recovery_reentry)
crypto_reconciliation_start broker=KrakenAdapter
crypto_reconciliation_snapshot equity=100000.00 buying_power=10000.00 positions=0
```

**No Contamination Indicators**:
- ✅ NO yfinance errors (previously: "ERROR | yfinance | Failed to get ticker 'SPY'")
- ✅ NO Alpaca adapter instantiation
- ✅ NO equity symbol loading (SPY/QQQ/IWM 100% blocked)
- ✅ CLEAN reconciliation with Kraken only

#### Git Commit

- **Status**: Ready for commit/merge

#### Phase Continuity

- ✅ Phase 0 invariants maintained (zero strategy logic changes)
- ✅ Phase 1 adapter unaffected (18/18 tests still passing)
- ✅ No external dependency additions

### 2026-02-05 — LIVE Trading Implementation with 8-Check Safety System

**Scope**: Live Trading / Production Deployment / Risk Management  
**Audience**: Engineer / Trading Operations / Compliance  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE — 8 mandatory startup checks, immutable JSONL ledger, order safety gates

#### Summary

Implemented production-grade LIVE trading system for Kraken crypto with fail-closed architecture. Eight mandatory startup checks prevent common production hazards: environment misconfiguration, missing/invalid API credentials, account safety violations, position reconciliation failures, strategy whitelisting, risk manager readiness, ML read-only enforcement, and mandatory dry-run verification. All orders logged to immutable JSONL ledger before execution.

#### Architecture: 8 Mandatory Startup Checks

Every LIVE trading deployment must pass ALL 8 checks or halt immediately (SystemExit):

| Check | Validation | Blocks If | Recovery |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 1. **Environment** | ENV=live | Not set or wrong | Set ENV=live |
| 2. **API Keys** | KRAKEN_API_KEY + KRAKEN_API_SECRET | Missing or empty | Provide valid keys |
| 3. **Account Safety** | Account equity > 0, no open leveraged positions | Safety violation | Verify account health |
| 4. **Position Reconciliation** | Local state matches broker exactly | Out of sync | Run reconciliation |
| 5. **Strategy Whitelist** | Only whitelisted strategies enabled | Unauthorized strategy active | Update config/code |
| 6. **Risk Manager Ready** | Risk manager instantiated and healthy | Not initialized | Check risk config |
| 7. **ML Read-Only Mode** | LIVE mode disables ML training | ML training enabled | Set ML_TRAINING_DISABLED=true |
| 8. **Dry-Run Mandatory** | First execution must pass dry-run | Dry-run failed | Debug locally first |

#### Implementation: 2 New Modules

**crypto/live_trading_startup.py** (520 lines)

Classes:
- `LiveTradingStartupVerifier`: Main orchestrator
- `LiveTradingVerificationError`: Exception for check failures

Main function:
```python
def verify_live_trading_startup() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Runs all 8 mandatory checks.
    
    Returns:
        dict with keys: {"check_1_environment": "OK", "check_2_api_keys": "OK", ...}
    
    Raises:
        SystemExit(1) if ANY check fails
        LiveTradingVerificationError with detailed error message
    """
```

Check implementations:
- `_check_environment()`: Validates ENV=live env var
- `_check_api_credentials()`: Validates Kraken API key/secret not empty
- `_check_account_safety()`: Queries Kraken account balance, validates > 0 and no leveraged positions
- `_check_position_reconciliation()`: Compares local ledger against Kraken /Account endpoint
- `_check_strategy_whitelist()`: Validates only approved strategies in config
- `_check_risk_manager()`: Instantiates RiskManager, validates healthy state
- `_check_ml_read_only()`: Confirms ML_TRAINING_DISABLED=true in LIVE mode
- `_check_dry_run_mandatory()`: Validates dry-run passed on this environment

**crypto/live_trading_executor.py** (430 lines)

Classes:
- `LiveOrderExecutor`: Order execution with safety gates
- `LiveOrderAuditLogger`: Immutable JSONL ledger manager
- `LiveOrderExecutionError`: Exception for order failures

Main methods:
```python
class LiveOrderExecutor:
    def execute_order(self, order_spec: OrderSpecification) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Execute order with safety gates.
        
        Args:
            order_spec: Size, type (LIMIT/POST_ONLY), symbol, price
        
        Returns:
            {"order_id": str, "status": "submitted|confirmed|failed", "timestamp_utc": str}
        
        Raises:
            LiveOrderExecutionError if validation fails
        """
        # 1. VALIDATE: Order size, type, symbol against risk limits
        # 2. LOG: Write to JSONL ledger (status=submitted)
        # 3. SUBMIT: Send to Kraken API (LIMIT orders only, no market orders)
        # 4. VERIFY: Poll order status
        # 5. LOG: Update ledger (status=confirmed|failed)
        # 6. RETURN: Execution result
```

Execution gates:
- **Market orders blocked**: Only LIMIT and POST_ONLY allowed (prevents slippage surprises)
- **Size validation**: Per-trade max 1%, per-symbol max 2%, daily loss max 2%
- **Immutable ledger**: All orders logged to JSONL before submission
- **Slippage modeling**: Log expected vs actual execution price (for backtesting)

Ledger format (JSONL, one record per line):
```json
{
  "order_id": "kraken-12345",
  "symbol": "XXBTZUSD",
  "side": "buy",
  "order_type": "LIMIT",
  "size": 0.001,
  "price": 42000.00,
  "status": "submitted",
  "submitted_at_utc": "2026-02-05T23:12:41.500Z",
  "confirmed_at_utc": "2026-02-05T23:12:45.200Z",
  "comment": "Long BTC signal from LongTermTrendFollower"
}
```

#### Integration in Startup Flow

**Modified files**:

**run_live_kraken_crypto.sh** (Updated)
- Added explicit gate: `if [ "$LIVE_TRADING_APPROVED" != "yes" ]; then exit 1; fi`
- User must explicitly set `LIVE_TRADING_APPROVED=yes` before starting
- Enhanced warnings with 8-check summary
- Passes environment variables to Docker container

**crypto_main.py** (Updated)
- Imports: `verify_live_trading_startup()` from crypto/live_trading_startup.py
- Modified `run_daemon()` function:
  - Detects LIVE mode: `if os.getenv("ENV") == "live"`
  - Calls `verify_live_trading_startup()` before CryptoScheduler instantiation
  - Halts if verification fails with detailed error logging
  - Logs "✓ LIVE trading verification complete" on success

#### Verification Checklist

Before deploying LIVE trading:

1. [ ] Environment variables set:
   ```bash
   export ENV=live
   export LIVE_TRADING_APPROVED=yes
   export KRAKEN_API_KEY="your-key"
   export KRAKEN_API_SECRET="your-secret"
   ```

2. [ ] Run verification script (dry-run):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mohan/Documents/SandBox/test/trading_app
   python crypto/live_trading_startup.py
   ```
   Expected output: "✓ All 8 checks PASSED"

3. [ ] Start daemon:
   ```bash
   LIVE_TRADING_APPROVED=yes bash run_live_kraken_crypto.sh
   ```

4. [ ] Monitor logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f live-kraken-crypto-global | grep "LIVE trading\|CHECK\|✓\|ERROR"
   ```

5. [ ] Expected startup logs:
   ```
   [INFO] LIVE trading startup verification in progress...
   [INFO] Check 1/8: Environment ✓
   [INFO] Check 2/8: API Credentials ✓
   [INFO] Check 3/8: Account Safety ✓
   [INFO] Check 4/8: Position Reconciliation ✓
   [INFO] Check 5/8: Strategy Whitelist ✓
   [INFO] Check 6/8: Risk Manager ✓
   [INFO] Check 7/8: ML Read-Only ✓
   [INFO] Check 8/8: Dry-Run Verification ✓
   [INFO] ✓ All 8 checks PASSED - LIVE trading enabled
   [INFO] CryptoScheduler starting...
   ```

#### Order Execution Workflow

1. **Signal Generated** (from strategy)
   ```
   LongTermTrendFollower.generate_signal() → OrderSpecification
   ```

2. **Risk Check** (pre-submission)
   ```
   RiskManager.check_order_against_limits() → OK | REJECTED
   ```

3. **Order Submission** (via LiveOrderExecutor)
   ```
   LiveOrderExecutor.execute_order(spec)
     ├─ VALIDATE: size, type, symbol
     ├─ LOG: ledger (status=submitted)
     ├─ SUBMIT: Kraken API (LIMIT only)
     ├─ POLL: confirm order filled
     ├─ LOG: ledger (status=confirmed)
     └─ RETURN: execution result
   ```

4. **Ledger Persistence**
   ```
   <scope>/ledger/trades.jsonl
   (immutable append-only log)
   ```

#### Rollback & Safety

**If LIVE trading has issues**:

1. **Stop immediately**:
   ```bash
   docker stop live-kraken-crypto-global
   ```

2. **Review ledger**:
   ```bash
   docker exec live-kraken-crypto-global tail -20 /app/persist/live_kraken_crypto_global/ledger/trades.jsonl
   ```

3. **Reconcile with Kraken**:
   ```bash
   # Query Kraken account status
   curl -X GET "https://api.kraken.com/0/private/TradeHistory" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KRAKEN_API_KEY"
   ```

4. **Rollback to paper mode**:
   ```bash
   bash run_paper_kraken_crypto.sh  # Test with paper traders
   ```

### 2026-02-05 — Phase 1: Kraken REST Adapter Implementation Complete

**Scope**: Phase 1 / Broker Adapter  
**Audience**: Engineer / Deployment  

**Status**: ✅ Complete — All 18 tests passing, zero Phase 0 regressions

#### Summary

Phase 1 implements a production-ready Kraken REST adapter with strict safety-first design. All orders are blocked by default (DRY_RUN=true) with explicit opt-in required for live trading.

#### Implementation

**New Modules** (4):
- `broker/kraken_signing.py` (175 lines) - HMAC-SHA512 deterministic signing per Kraken spec
- `broker/kraken_client.py` (295 lines) - REST HTTP client with rate limiting (3 req/sec), connection pooling, exponential backoff
- `broker/kraken_adapter.py` (630 lines) - Full BrokerAdapter interface (paper + live modes)
- `broker/kraken_preflight.py` (195 lines) - 5-check startup verification (env vars, connectivity, auth, permissions, sanity)

**Modified Modules** (4):
- `broker/broker_factory.py` - Kraken routing, DRY_RUN/ENABLE_LIVE_ORDERS env var reading, preflight integration
- `execution/runtime.py` - Preflight check hook after broker instantiation
- `config/crypto/live.kraken.crypto.global.yaml` - Phase 1 safety section (DRY_RUN=true, ENABLE_LIVE_ORDERS=false defaults)
- `README.md` - Phase 1 documentation and safety guarantees

**New Test File** (18 tests):
- `tests/broker/test_kraken_adapter.py` - Comprehensive Kraken adapter testing

#### Safety Architecture

**Dual Safety Gates**:
1. **DRY_RUN=true** (default) - Blocks all orders with logging
2. **ENABLE_LIVE_ORDERS=false** (default) - Requires explicit opt-in before live orders allowed

**Code-Level Guarantees**:
- No withdrawal methods exist (impossible to enable)
- Preflight verification aborts startup if credentials/connectivity invalid
- Symbol validation (BTC, ETH, SOL allowed)
- Min order size enforcement per symbol
- CASH_ONLY_TRADING=true preserved from Phase 0

**Startup Verification** (5 checks, live mode only):
1. Environment variables present (KRAKEN_API_KEY, KRAKEN_API_SECRET)
2. Connectivity (public SystemStatus endpoint reachable)
3. Authentication (private Balance endpoint responds)
4. Permissions (OpenOrders endpoint accessible)
5. Sanity (withdrawal not used)

#### Configuration Defaults

```yaml
KRAKEN:
  PHASE_1_SAFETY:
    DRY_RUN: true                      # Block all orders by default
    ENABLE_LIVE_ORDERS: false          # Require explicit approval
    MAX_NOTIONAL_PER_ORDER: 500.0      # Prevent large orders
   SYMBOL_ALLOWLIST: [BTC, ETH, SOL, LINK, AVAX]  # Only safe symbols
```

#### Test Results

- Phase 1 tests: **18/18 PASSING**
- Phase 0 regression: **24/24 PASSING** (zero regressions)
- **Total: 42/42 PASSING**

#### Git Commit

- **Commit**: f3b55df
- **Branch**: feature/crypto-kraken-global
- **Date**: Feb 5, 2026

#### Phase Roadmap

- **Phase 1.1** (Current): Dry-run safe, read-only + simulated orders
- **Phase 1.2** (Next): Canary live orders (requires human approval + sandbox validation)
- **Phase 2** (Future): WebSocket market data, advanced order types

### 2025-11 — Screener: Rule-Based US Equities Filtering

**Scope**: Screener Tool / Feature Development  
**Audience**: User  

**Status**: Complete — Minimal, explainable screener

#### Summary

Minimal rule-based screener for 43+ US equities. Computes technical features, assigns confidence scores (1-5) using transparent logic, ranks symbols without ML.

#### Features

- Loads daily OHLCV data (yfinance)
- Computes 9 technical indicators (SMA, ATR, pullback depth, volume ratio)
- Assigns confidence via rule-based scoring (transparent, tunable)
- Ranks and displays top 20 candidates
- Demo mode (synthetic data, no network required)
- Production mode (real data, yfinance)

#### Scoring Rules

```
+1 if close > SMA_200 (above long-term trend)
+1 if SMA20_slope > 0 (short-term momentum positive)
+1 if pullback_depth < 5% (shallow pullback)
+1 if vol_ratio > 1.2 (volume 20% above average)
+1 if atr_pct < 3% (volatility < 3% of price)
→ Final confidence = max(1, min(score, 5))
```

#### Test & Run

```bash
# Demo (synthetic data)
python3 demo.py

# Production (real data)
python3 main.py
```

#### Symbols Included

43 liquid US equities: SPY, QQQ, IWM (ETFs); AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA (mega-cap tech); JPM, BAC, GS, BRK.B, AXP (finance); JNJ, UNH, PFE, ABBV, MRK (healthcare); and more.
